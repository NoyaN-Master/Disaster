Fuller grunted and replied with his gas mask amplified voice: \n "You and your brigade is going to shell the mines, and my army is going to blitz through the city and burn their supplies." \n The guard nodded in confusion, not understanding how Fuller could be this cold and apathetic in a situation like this. He asked the notorious general: "Sir, what are we going to do about the women and the children? Our scouts report that the families of the militants live in the mines or the city itself. Should I dispatch a team to recover th-"\n Fuller pulls the safety of his gun, blocking the enforcer's voice. Fuller grunts: \n "They provide warmth and food to the militans. I will not elaborate further.""

You and your militants will go on a Jihad against them. Do it for Allah, and your late mother and your precious brothers that these Munafıq horde have taken from you. Allahu Akbar!" said Fuller to the native militant in perfect Turkish.\n "I understand Sir Fuller, we have heard your name in bad situations but I can see that you are not a bad person, but instead a hero to opressed peoples like ours. We will commence the attack now."\nThe militant gathered his men and started an attack on the motherbase using weapons from Fuller's arsenal.\n "What are we going to do with them when they conquer the Motherbase?" asks an officer of German origin.\n "They will not conquer it. Upon their penetration of the motherbase, we will deploy our artillery barrage and drive a tank into the complex, giving the illusion of fraternity to jihadis meanwhile we will go on the second part of the program, where we drop the Sulfur mustard, known to the world as Mustard Gas thank to your Kaiser."\n The officer stood there for a second. His skin went pale from the horrors he will commit under the rule of this man, but he knew that this was the right thing to do."
