qid.1.t:0 "Puppet and Master"
qid.1.d:0 "When Puyi had taken the offer to once again become Emperor of China, he had readily taken it swifter then a cheetah. He had been in exile from China since 1927, living in Japan and England, and had been desperate to reclaim his throne and his title. Of course as Puyi now understood, that desperation had largely been a childlike obsession with power and influence that was not befitting of the Emperor's actual abilities. Puyi, when it came down to it, was a weak man in many respects. He was intelligent sure, but he was physically weak, unable to put on any muscle whatsoever, and emotionally and socially stunted in many many ways. He had been unable to develop proper friendships until his exile of a few years, and in that time he had only found friends in people who were forced to serve him. He had been used by his teacher as a marketing tool, making things "approved by the Emperor of China" and being used like a puppet once again as like how it had been with the Dowager Empress. So he broke away, and he was given an interesting offer by a group of Japanese and Manchurians in Manchuria. They were forming a expedition of Imperialists to reform the Qing Empire within China, and they wanted Puyi as their Emperor once again. After taking the offer and being imported to the region, it had not taken long for China to shatter once again as it had many, many times in history. With his forced Puyi siezed the capital region of Beijing from the murderous warlord Dai Li, who had split away from the horrible Chiang. It was here, in Beijing, that Puyi sat in his favorite Tea Room and drank his tea, tea he had proudly made all by himself for the second time in his life. He thought he was becoming rather good at it all things considered, even if he had spilled the tea cakes and part of the boiling water on the floor. Although the tea calmed him, Puyi still had a nagging thought in the back of his mind that no pleasantry would ever fix. He was becoming concerned with the reliance on Japanese officers within the army, and how the Japanese had consistantly treated the Manchu soldiers who fought alongside them. They did not respect him or his soldiers, and they again would try to make Puyi a puppet within his own Empire. Will the Emperor break free of his strings and forge his own path forwards, or will he again be nothing more then a wooden beast on strings, being moved with no will of his own?"

qid.2.t:0 "The Japanese Exiles"
qid.2.d:0 "Japan was currently not in a good state, to say the least. Widespread internal instability and a harsh settler program had led hundreds of thousands of Japanese to Manchuria in search of decent wages and decent quality of life, and for many former members of the Imperial Japanese Army it showed promise as a Mercenary's paradise. The central Manchurian government had next to no legitimacy other then sheer force, and its rejection and suppression of any sort of Chinese identity had led it to be almost universally reviled. The Japanese colonial government, desperate for the exploitation of resources, had decided to use the Native Chinese as slave labor with a Manchu administrative and soldier caste above them, and the Japanese naturally being on top. Although to the high level corporates and administrators this had sounded like a perfect idea, in reality there was simply not enough manpower to make that idea a reality. So in order to make up for that lack of men willing to serve, many thousands of mercenaries were imported from across the world, any person willing to serve the Manchurian Corporations and the Colonial government was accepted, no questions asked. From this eclectic mixed band many legends found their home, but two men in particular would go on to join the "Qing Expedition" as it had them been known: Shigeru Honjō, the Butcher of Hsinking, and Teikichi Hori, the Old Admiral. Honjō was a brutal man, a devout follower of the far right of Japanese politics, he had found himself in Manchuria as part of an official armed delegation to the colony before horrible instability within Japan itself had forced him to have an extended stay within Manchuria. His delegation no longer having a command to report to, his forces fell in with the Mercenaries of Manchuria, and doing so had not especially pleased Honjō. He was a strict believer in Japanese supremacy, and as such did not wish to associate with the whites and other races who served. Hori was rather the opposite, a sensitive and wise navy man, he had been exiled from Japan with the very far right that Honjō had supported hot on his heels. He had managed to secure himself a position within the Manchurian navy, but coming political tides were to again force his hasty withdrawal. Although neither man was found of each other, they had formed together for the good of the Japanese who were now in a foreign land."

qid.3.t:0 "The Emperor's Choice"
qid.3.d:0 "The Japanese had been leaning on Puyi for weeks now, their threats becoming ever less veiled in "concern for the safety of the Emperor" and ever more in the line of a Yakuza. They had continued to state their case on the matter of who should be given command over the armies of the Qing Empire, and it seemed most obvious to them that it would be them. They had the most military experience after all, they had the best training and the best weapons and the best supply contacts, they were the only real choice in terms of military strategy. But they were also cruel, and generally hated by the vast majority of the Chinese population, and most clearly did not care for the Qing cause nor for the rights or safety of the Emperor. Their experience had so far been used as a bargaining chip to be able to have relevance within the Qing Imperial Court, and they were now making a definite move towards the consolidation of power towards their own ends, much to the dismay of Puyi. Puyi now had a choice to make, and one that either way would not be an easy one to make. On one side, the more reasonable option, he could simply allow the Japanese to command the Qing army, as their experience and training would allow for the Qing army to become a truly professional fighting force in a civil war mainly against militias and reserves. However, this would crush the morale of the Qing troops within the army and the general population as a whole, and no doubt Puyi would find himself being increasingly shoved into a corner as the Exiles consolidated their power. However the alternative was rather insane, Puyi himself would declare himself absolute military commander, despite having no military credentials nor training whatsoever. This would most definitely not improve the professionalism of the Qing force, but the army would most probably have its morale boosted from the Emperor himself leading them. Puyi had somewhat of an idea on what to do on military matters, at least he had a plan, try to win the population over to his side, and the country would inevitably follow suit. Still, Puyi would have to make his choice now, either stay a puppet for yet another set of greedy men, or for the first time in his life take charge and put himself in a position of genuine rulership."

qid.4.t:0 "Cherry Blossoms"
qid.4.d:0 "Shigeru Honjō stood across from Teikichi Hori, the quiet winds of the outside blowing on the wooden shutters that covered the window. The two man sat and drank sake, true, but neither one felt especially close to the other. Both were men who had been placed out of their nation and our of their identity, but neither man would stoop to the level to admit something like that. Instead they quietly sat and drank sake and beer, they did not talk, they did not even look at each other. They were victorious in their efforts to convince the fool Emperor to giving power of the army to them, but now they both understood that one of them was not making it out of their scheme with their shirt. They were opposites after all, rivals in ever way and every belief, they they had somehow come together in their darkest hour and united all the Japanese they could scrape together for a last ditch effort like this. So far it appeared to be working, but the winds of heaven blow in erratic ways, and it was a very real possibility that in the future their house of cards would come tumbling down. A sheet of thunder echoed across the sky as Hori went for another drink, his hands stiff and his mind cold, there was work to be done. Honjō did not drink any more, he was simply thinking of what the future held. Outside the new "Japanese Special Force" did their training in the rain and the mud, brandishing their imported rifles and uniforms in a nostalgic call back to the Empire of the Rising sun and its former glory. It was cute, but it was not in any way what the real thing had been all those years ago, and both of the men inside knew that all too well. Still, they would try with what they could to restore the Imperial Army, even if it meant using the Chinese to do it."

qid.5.t:0 "The Emperor's Will"
qid.5.d:0 "Puyi sat upon his throne made of jade, three Japanese officers stood before him, bowing, unlike before their bows were now genuine articles of awe. He had rejected the Japanese attempt to sweep the rug from underneath him, even if he was not educated terrible in the matters of intrigue he could see that much at the least. He dismissed them, leaving them to their own devices as simply officers within the army, not the great dictators they had sought themselves to be using the power that Puyi represented. That was his power, he was the Emperor, and he was not going to let any man or woman take advantage of him again, he was going to use his power to improve the Chinese people and bring them into the 20th century as much as he could. Over the last few weeks, Puyi had rapidly improved in his reading skills, and he had attempted to read the works that had so influenced the revolutionaries of 1911 to overthrow the Empire in the first place. What had made the Chinese people not trust the Qing, and what could be done to build that trust up once again. Some of the works were inevitably easier for Puyi, the philosophical quandaries of Spinoza being easier to understand then whatever in heaven's name a "Dialectical Materialism" is, but Puyi could still understand the broad strokes of why the people had rebelled. The Qing had simply refused to update themselves, to move forward, and had maintained their traditions beyond any reasonable extent for the sake of their traditions and nothing else. It was silly really, and Puyi had swore to himself that he was determined not to make the same mistakes his ancestors had, and to try and improve China as the great Emperors of long ago once had. Most proudly of all, Puyi had managed to pour himself a cup of tea without spilling it, and even sweetened it by himself with sugar that had been brought to him, it was obvious to anybody that he was now ready for the trials and tribulations of absolute rulership."

qid.6.t:0 "Emperor or Minister?"
qid.6.d:0 "Emperor had another choice laid on his plate, and it was another choice he dearly did not wish to make. The war was coming to a close, and political figures both near and far had begun to call for a solution to the political situation that had encapsulated the Qing Empire. The Japanese and much of the Chinese elements within the population and government had called for the formation of a parliamentarian system of government, an emulation of the British and formerly Japanese system of government. Under this banner two men had risen to the top of the political ladder, those being Shigeru Honjō and Teikichi Hori. Hori had found his market with the Chinese and more moderate Japanese sections of the population, wishing for a modern, cautiously progressive, and liberal Monarchy under the vein of the British system. Although not dramatic, Hori has been a figure of stability within the Empire, and his politics would, if nothing else, allow China to function under a truly modern system once again. Hori additionally supports a policy of multiculturalism and general racial and cultural equality, adding the Japanese as equal citizens to the Han and Manchu peoples of China. Honjō did not have much of the sensitivity that Hori possessed, and is reviled by all but the most radical of Japanese immigrants within the Empire. Supportive of a "total" restoration of "Imperial Power", Honjō in reality wishes to form the Empire into a nationalistic and totalitarian state, with the Japanese as the top of the ethnic chain in a new caste system. His government would not exactly be rife with stability, and the positives are hard to ascertain as trying to from an ethnostate where less then 5% of your population belongs to said ethnicity is tricky to say the least. Lastly, the Emperor could reasonably declare that there would be no election for Prime Minister, and declare a true restoration of Imperial rule, at least until the current crisis is over. Puyi has over the recent months educated himself on the methods of governance by many sources, and has promised a syncratic rule where only the most effective policy would be enacted, no matter the origin of said policy. In reality Puyi was simply planning to restore many elements of the government of Wang with an Imperial flair, but if it worked then it would probably work now. Regardless the choice is approaching, and with it the future of China..."
