### EVENTS ### 

fullerunification.1.t:0 "Bloody Normality"
fullerunification.1.d:0 "'Squadron three to base, this is Easy two, we are approaching target, operation Lithic is underway.' the bomber radio crackled, most of the bombers in service were old enough to be a pilot's wife, and the utilities weren't much better. The response was fragmented, but it hardly matter anyways, they were going to be doing the same thing they had been doing for the last few weeks, and the few weeks before that, and so on. They are deployed to a region, they bomb the bloody shit out of it, and then they fly off to the next place to do it all again. Every week the countryside has become more unrecognisable as all squadrons in the country are doing the same thing, clearing out traitors and those who dare to fight against the will of the state. Last week they had been in Konya, or as the boys called it 'Konie', and they had left that place twisted and black enough to be a Turk's hair. David thought to himself as he sat at the radioman's desk, the wind charts in front of him alongside a strong bottle of gin, how the hell is this country even going to function after all of this? It seems like every day they just kill more and more of the population and destroy more and more of the farms and infrastructure, some day there won't be any place left to bomb! 'Target 30 clicks out, approaching soon, arming now.' the bomber had switched off all the safety levers, one push of the big red button under his thumb and the bombs would go flying down once again. 'Jesus lads, the whole damn countryside is burnt to shit, I can't find the damn place.' David looked over the charts and shot back, 'You bleeding moron Henry, we are going to pass over it any second, drop the bombs!'. \n\n The Bomber pressed his thumb down, and a dozens of 100k bombs came raining down upon the landscape below, and as David looked through his periscope he saw a small village surrounded by blackness, probably a population of a few hundred, slowly but surely removed from the map as little dots of red and yellow filled the landscape. This might have been traumatising if he thought about the horrible implications of his actions, but after the 20th village you bomb you tend to become desensitised to the whole affair. The bomber blurted out 'It's all clear, target has been neutralised, time to get our asses back home.', David just gave a simply thumbs up and continued to look over his maps, they had a lot more villages to burn and not a lot of time to do it."
fullerunification.1.a:0 "Anyone up for some tea?"

fullerunification.2.t:0 "The United Front"
fullerunification.2.d:0 "A propaganda leaflet falls over a dusty street in some backwater village far in the countryside, it reads as such - 'The nation of Turkey is surrounded and occupied on all sides by the western imperialist and its lap dog Fuller. He murders and rapes with reckless abandon as the mothers watch their children fed into the furnace of hell, lambs to the slaughter of the modern demon of the nation. He will not stop until he has drank the blood of all the innocent, and only in death may the Turk know peace. All true Turkish men, regardless of what they were before, must today unite against the manifestation of the devil itself. No matter if the flag they held before was red, black, white, or blue, only by uniting may the future of the Turkish people be saved! Brothers of all nations, brothers of all Gods, brothers of all ideologies, fight against the rot and gangrene of Fuller and for a better and more just land!' the leaflet flies away to the wind, its message reaching no one in particular."
fullerunification.2.a:0 "A Final Hope?"

fullerunification.3.t:0 "Black Ops"
fullerunification.3.d:0 "The men gripped their rifles with a tight resolve, as the scouting party of one of the countryside Black Brigade 'roam squads' inches up along the parapet adjacent to a newly found enemy encampment. The camp was no small fry, it had a few hundred people within it, and with the rifles in their hands it could be assumed that they were Turkish guerrillas or bandits. Either way went the same for them, and the punishment was the same too. The scouts reported back to their roam squad, which managed to call in a few more squads and a plane to assist them. The battle was brief but brutal, the Black Brigade members shot down on the camp while they slept, easily removing all current and future combatants in the camp, alongside any assistants to combatants that may have cooked or anything else. While searching amongst the bodies, a man of a rotund build and proper uniform was found, which was assumed to be the wanted Fevzi Pasha, however among the mud and varying fluids and solids it was difficult to for sure parse such a thing. The squads would get a pay bonus if they reported killing him however, so they did so as quickly as they could. The squads moved on quickly, continuing to roam wherever they would need to clean and polish the landscape which has been left burnt and charred from the many air campaigns Fuller loves so much."
fullerunification.3.a:0 "The numbers don't matter here."

fullerunification.4.t:0 "Men and Dogs"
fullerunification.4.d:0 "The Turk continues to be a plague upon this land despite all of our efforts, but luckily we are not alone in our struggle against the horrid barbarians. The Armenian people are another white folk in these lands who, despite everything, have managed to hold their identity and race together. Our British settlement projects along the northern and eastern coasts have met only moderate success, as the actual amount of British people willing to come to Anatolia is a handful at best. The British settlement programs have given us experience however, and have taught us how we could realistically take these lands back, one piece at a time. Using the Armenian people, we will set up a chain of settlement programs to take over the homes and towns of the Turks in the region, and slowly but surely replace the Turkish population and force them into a smaller and smaller area until they are no longer an issue. The Armenians deserve as much of Eastern Anatolia as they can hold after all, they are our surviving white brothers and the descendants of Alexander the Great and the great stronghold of civilization in the east. We will establish a Armenian settlement police to make sure that the Turks leave and give their homes to the Armenians, but as the Turks are a naturally lazy people this should not be difficult action to take. The inner countryside that we will push the Turks into is a blackened land by our bombing campaign, so it is unlikely that they could cause much trouble from there. Although we naturally do not approve of the Yankee menace, we can say that their treatment of the Native American was very effective in clearly their country from those troublemakers, so perhaps this frontier and settlement attitude could be used here as well. Those westerns are such enjoyable movies too, with their great White heroes fighting against those dirty Indians, it is a great representation of the power of the White spirit and where the god's favour lies." 
fullerunification.4.a:0 "Turkish Tears."

fullerunification.5.t:0 "The Mysteries"
fullerunification.5.d:0 "Fuller had always been fascinated about the occult and the strange, its part of what had pushed him into researching politics or going to this cursed land in the first place after all. It was the ancient land of the Greeks, of Alexander the Great, of the beginnings of Christianity and of the Sword of Islam, it was a land with a great history plagued with the curse that is the Turk. Even if he could not fully remove the Turk, he could destroy the influence that its degenerate eastern culture had on these oh so holy lands. From this Fuller had decided to research and study, to create a religion that could destroy the deathly strength of Islam and the weak pathetic influence of Christianity. A white man's religion that could push this land to restore the Great Empires that once stood in it, and from that research came two points. Firstly, the Hellenic Gods must be brought back from the grave to once again lord over men, as it was their strength and power that had led men such as Alexander and the 300 to victory against the Eastern Barbarians. Secondly, they must understand that these Hellenic Gods were in fact manifestations of the influence of the Praeterhuman beings who surrounded humanity always, and have gone by many different names. These beings have no true names, rather they are the 'Gods' of men who have influenced us for all of time, and they shall continue to influence humanity and guide it to the final end of our existence. To worship these beings is the true and just faith, and the strength that these beings give can only be expressed by the power of the gun, the power of dominance in a relationship between the slave and the master. The Turkic peoples are the slaves of the Masters, they shall not understand the mysteries, only blindly worship the Gods of old without understanding how to use their power. \n\n There is no love in this relationship and there never will be, the objective of the dominance of the Master over the Slave is so the Master may have the luxury of True will, but this luxury cannot be given freely. Only the White man may hold the True Will, and only the White man may use its magic to restructure the world of the barbarian in his image. The Turkics shall run in fear as the magic of Zeus will strike them down from above with the direction of their Prophet and Hero Fuller, savior of Anatolia."
fullerunification.5.a:0 "From Olympus the Lightning Strikes!"

fullerunification.6.t:0 "Time's Up"
fullerunification.6.d:0 "Anatolia has had a fairly large Jewish population for quite a long time, ever since the Ottoman Empire opened its arms to Jews escaping the Spanish Inquisition during the 15th century. This one action is one of the many things that has doomed Anatolia, until now. They Jewish population of Anatolia currently stands at 200,000 individuals, primarily in the rural areas of the center of the country or the city of Constantinople. Fuller in his forgiveness and compassion has given several deadlines for a certain region and portion of the Jewish population to leave the country, by two years from now all Jews will be expected to leave the country and practice their ways elsewhere. This policy has met surprising resistance among the native population, as Jews make up a 'large portion of the academia and private sector' and 'removing them would destroy the economy'. Of course both of these reasons is a significant part of why we are doing this in the first place, as their influence upon the economy and academia is unacceptable, and we must limit their power in any way possible. During these deadlines we will also confiscate all of their belongings, as compensation for their presence within the country, which is only fair. We shall guarantee their safety of course, not for their sake but for ours. The mechanics of actually removing their population with absolute force would be entirely possible, but the expenses of the venture would not be worth it when we could spend more resources on the production of weaponry and Methamphetamine. So a compromise must be made until the economic situation of the country can be rectified, so deadlines of expulsion will have to do for now.\n\nThe international community is of course in a very mild uproar about our activities, but the international community does not control Anatolia, and if they wish to actually stop the activities of our regime they should grow some bloody balls and come take their word up with us. But the international community is under the control of the weak willed fighters against the true empire of the White man, and they can only sob and moan at our activities, as the Gods and the people are on our side."
fullerunification.6.a:0 "Well, it could probably be worse..."

fullerunification.7.t:0 "The Atom"
fullerunification.7.d:0 "The magic of the power of the atom is an incredible thing, it can power everything a man could want, and it provides a lovely enriched product at the end of it all that has boundless uses. It also can provide power to the entirety of Constantinople with a vastly reduced amount of manpower and overall cost and input, which allows a reduced logistical and monetary strain on the local and national government. Of course none of this boundless power will be afforded to the local Turkish population, making in many eyes this project entirely pointless, but Fuller knows of its true terrible purpose, one that shall rid the world of the Mongol Hordes once and for all! That is later though, for now we shall have a cup of tea and our lovely power provided by the shining light of the split atom."
fullerunification.7.a:0 "Another victory for the Anglo-Saxon race."

fullerunification.8.t:0 "One Fateful Night"
fullerunification.8.d:0 "It had been a long time coming. This evening, following the orders of Fuller himself, soldiers began gathering outside their barracks, and after being given the orders, started marching towards their targets.\n\nIn the middle of the night, thousands of leftist leaders and leftist supporters, including the likes of those who took up arms against our regime and those who didn't, were rounded up from their homes, most of them still asleep.\n\nThey were taken to the town square of their respective towns where they were all told 'You are here because you have been found guilty of treason against the state. Your punishment is death.'\n\nFollowing that, armed men began lining them up in order to carry out their punishment and while some tried to resist, it just resulted in them being severely beaten up. Immediately after they were all lined up , the soldiers took position and, with the quick pull of a trigger, all of the men now lay dead on the ground. Most of their bodies then carried away but a few of them, particularly those of leftist leaders, were left behind as a grim reminded to what happens to those who resist our regime.\n\nIn the morning afterward, Fuller gave a public speech, announcing how all leftists in the country would meet the same fate and that what happened last night was only the beginning." 
fullerunification.8.a:0 "§RClose your hearts to pity.§!"

fullerunification.9.t:0 "Pest Control"
fullerunification.9.d:0 "The Turks need to be organised and controlled, like any pest, their infection is such that we cannot realistically crush them all at once. Rather we must grind them between the stones of less living space and less resources to shrink their population into a manageable about. We will continue the settlement programs throughout the country to continue to isolate the Turks within the center of the country, but we will also begin to breed reliance from the Turks on our food distribution rather then local means. In majority Turkish areas that we seek to settle, we shall shut down the majority of local farms in exchange for providing free food from our central food distribution center in each area, with each town or village having its own food center. In these centers the local Turkish people will be able to have free but rationed amounts of food and other goods, limiting their ability to raise a family. From what we have calculated each couple of Turkish people will only be able to have one child maximum, which shall resulting in a massive reduction to their population growth and allow for our Natalist policies towards settlers to dramatically overtake the local Turks. We will also spread the Turks around the country more evenly through regular forced migrations, allowing for more regions to be settler majority and disorienting any potential rebellious figures or plans in the processes. Lastly we can put contraceptives within the food supply that we distribute to the Turkish people, which although expensive will allow for a dramatic decrease in population growth.\n\nThis contraceptive plan will probably be limited to high priority areas such as Constantinople, as the world supply of birth control would probably not be enough to cover what we would realistically need to cover. On the other hand we will have to open ourselves to more diverse groups of white settlers to fill in the gaps in the economy and country, such as Germans, Dutch, Belgians, or god forbid the French. Still, our Black Brigades and Settlement police can handle any rebellious groups, and any attempts at resistance are met with immediate and overwhelming violence."
fullerunification.9.a:0 "From Bronze to Silver"

fullerunification.10.t:0 "No Enemy Kings"
fullerunification.10.d:0 "The business man that does not fight alongside your interests is the enemy, fuller is no socialist, he understands the value of the market and of the capitalist, but these things must be subservient to the will of the state. When the state allows the capitalist and the business man to do what his wishes, it ends with the state being overturned by the business and the power being lost to the degenerate individual rather then for the objective of the nation as a whole. From this we can also come to understand that nobody is more evil then the foreign capitalist, for the foreign capitalist can only be an enemy of the state, there is no situation where the foreigner works in the interest of the state, only against it. This is exactly why the Jew cannot be allowed to be a capitalist within a country, nor a French man, for both are always foreigners in civilization. Rather only the Anglo-Saxon can be a true capitalist, for as all historians know Capitalism was invented in England, and anybody who says the filthy dutch had any involvement shall be shown the error of their ways. From all of these logical proceedings we can take the sound view that anybody who is not of the proper race and nationality within our country and is acting in a capitalistic manner shall be promptly expelled from the country to wherever they came, and their assets shall be seized and given to a capitalist of sound mind, body, and race. This is the only logical path to take on the issue, any other means of attempting redistribution would be socialistic, which is of course a creation of the degenerate and the liar.\n\nHopefully by the end of this program we can solidly say that the few capitalists of sound race within the country will have consolidated enough power to guarantee the power of the Anglo within these barbaric lands, and the Turk will have been relegated to the labourer at best. There have been grumbles about all of this of course, petty bitching, calls of the typical authoritarianisms, but nothing we have not been called before. The only issue is that some of the nations that these businessmen come from are not necessarily approving of our policy, and may wish to see some kind of recompense. Hopefully this can be sorted without too much trouble, but if Fuller has learned anything, you can kill as many people as you want but the moment you touch businesses, you are fucked."

fullerunification.11.t:0 "White Lightning"
fullerunification.11.d:0 "Soldiers understand the risks they take by enlisting, this is something that should be understood by ever man within a nation, no matter his position. The risk of soldiering is great but the glory and guts that are gained are far worth the detriment to health. By this metric, what is a drug but merely another risk that a soldier puts upon himself? The soldier understands that he may die at any moment, and the drug is merely another way to improve his odds at the cost of later health, similar to training or any sort of risk in battle. Methamphetamine, the most glorious of soldier improving tools, is just another tool to add to the pile, another spear in the hand of the warrior. We are aware of the side effects, of the addiction, of the shortened lifespan, but what our soldiers do not know will not hurt them. By adding Meth to their everyday rations we can make sure that our soldiers are always alert, always ready for battle, and without the need for weaknesses such as rest or food. Our soldiers shall stand tall in the face of danger, looking down the barrel of a gun, and laugh in the face of death. They shall be like lightening against the degenerate hordes, the fire swirling from their rifles twisting and burning all those who dare stand in their way, and some of them may die from overdose, but that is a risk that the officers are willing to make. Production has been started in the few regions that still have a functional medical industry, with resources being diverted from making vaccines and painkillers to the production of Meth. Industrial quantities will be difficult to acquire, but through the black market we can grab as much as we can to further improve our supply, and these black market connections can prove useful later on as well. \n Soldiers who face late stage use of Meth will be put into the suicide battalions as per usual, we have plenty of men itching to replace them, especially since the only job available in this damned land is being a solider anyways. We just have to make sure to keep our methamphetamine supply constant, or else we will have soldiers stealing copper pipes and rifles to sell for more of the stuff!"

fullerunification.12.t:0 "Dark Expanse"
fullerunification.12.d:0 "Ever since taking power, the Black Brigades have stretched themselves on their many duties, severely so. They are the acting police force of any area not currently under settlement such as Constantinople, they are the enforcement of the doctrine and will of Fuller, they are the 'solvers' of Turkic issues, they are the security force for all state functions, and they are a functional military organization entirely separate from the military. All of these duties together have the organization barely functioning as they must spread their forces so thin that some towns only have a single Black Brigade member to enforce Fuller's will and solve Turk issues. Fuller has realized this issue for a very long time, but he has been unable to properly counteract it, as the number of proper blooded Anglo-Saxons within Anatolia is small to say the least. The issue was somewhat counteracted by paying for young British men and veterans to come to the country, but Anglo-Saxons are also the only people who may serve state functions, making their race more desperately needed within the government bureaucracy rather then within the Black Brigades. Finally Fuller has come to an uncomfortable but functional solution, they shall encourage immigration from other nations within Europe and press them into the Black Brigades. This does ruin the racial purity of the organization, but by putting them in separate rather then mixed units, we can at least try to preserve the organisation's legitimacy to some degree. Still, this will probably harm morale within the organization, but there simply isn't enough pure raced men to go around, and the day that they hire a Turk or a Woman is the day that Agartha is discovered.\n\nThis influx of members will allow the Black Brigades to properly do the law enforcement they have been pressed into, at least until we can form a proper police force that can take their place. It will also take pressure off of the settlement police, who have been expanding their jurisdiction to try and maintain some semblance of law and order within Fuller's Anatolia, as if it is not apparent, stability has not been a number one priority."

fullerunification.14.t:0 "The New Alexander"
fullerunification.14.d:0 "Fuller is a lover of history, a student of it, in fact you could say he is obsessed with it. In many of his policies and his speeches he loves to add historic and archaic language as a symbol of his education and aristocratic linage, even if it makes him seem like a ponce. His Black Brigades after all wear outdated stand collars and all black not because that is in any way practical, but rather because it entertains the man's ideal of soldiery and aesthetic more so then his good sense. In a continuation of this policy position, Fuller declared that his army shall no longer be referred to simply as the "National Army". Rather, his army shall be the "New Macedon Army", and it would be having some changes in its policy and its uniform. Officers will be issued a (cheap) replication of a Hoplite Sword, and will be expected to wear a classical style of plumage on top of their helmet at all times. This plumage will be dark purple, which is also the new colour of the officer's uniform, not helped by the shiny steel breast plate that all soldiers are now required to wear. Common soldiers, alongside this breast plate that is too thin to serve anything but aesthetic purpose, are issued with sandals and a new light green uniform which does not blend well into the landscape of Anatolia, but does have a good sense of aesthetic style. Common soldiers are given a dagger in vague imitation of the Hoplite Sword issued to officers, and like the Sword also lacks much modern purpose as its cheap construction does not allow for a great amount of use. In the capital this New Army marched, with ancient styles of form and dress, and chanting war songs in badly pronounced Greek, saying that they were ready for battle against the enemies of the New Alexander, Fuller.\n\nAlthough met with scoffs from much of the local population, Fuller is proud of his achievement at reviving the legacy of Alexander, and knows that this army will be remembered in the same vein as the Grand Army of Napoleon. Their bright colours and proud steps can be seen from miles away, their pride carried on their shoulders as they fight against the Mongols and Barbarians of these Turkic lands, with every victory they shall bring glory to the white man and all that he has done here."

The overlordship of Egypt by Oswald Mosely will be ended and will be absorbed into Fuller's empire. And, the Suez was reluctantly given to Fuller, with the promises from him that it would always be open to the English and their Allies, and with few restrictions in the zone."
