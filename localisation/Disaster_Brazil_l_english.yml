bra.1.t:0 "Integralists march on São Paulo!"
bra.1.d:0 "A country of political turmoil and strife, one could forgive Brazilians for believing that their country needs to be put at rest politically, but it appears that is not the case. Supporters of integralist groups across the nation descended upon São Paulo today, claiming that Getúlio Vargas has failed Brazil, and does not hold God in his heart like a righteous man. Vargas is yet to comment."
bra.1.a:0 "Let them speak, who are we to censor free speech?"

bra.2.t:0 "The AIB gain power in Parliament!"
bra.2.d:0 "After the scenes at São Paulo less than a month ago, the Integralist movements who took to the city appear to have been swept up by the all-encompassing Ação Integralista Brasileira. This party is making more demands in parliament by the day, believing themselves the only ones fit to run the country. Even though they call proudly call themselves fascist, it opens the question. Can we tar all movements like this with the German brush?"
bra.2.a:0 "Yes, it's Nazism through and through! Shut them down!"
bra.2.b:0 "No, censoring them would make us no better than tyrants."

bra.3.t:0 "Gustavo Barroso arrested?"
bra.2.d:0 "Today, the house of prominent AIB supporter Gustavo Barroso has been raided, and he has been taken into custody by Rio police, claimed to be conspiring to undermine the state with the AIB. While supporters of Getúlio Vargas claim that Gustavo was seeking to harm the state, riots and protests have broken out amongst AIB members. They claim that Gustavo Barroso is a victim of a wicked police state, and that he's little more than voiceless in the apparent oncoming show trial. The world holds it's breath, for surely nothing good can come of this. Right?"
bra.3.a:0 "We gave them an inch and they took a mile. Arrest Gustavo now!"
bra.3.b:0 "Gustavo, anauê! We'll set you free!"
