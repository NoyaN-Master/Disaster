crf.1.t:0 "The Demon King"
crf.1.d:0 "The young man ran through the twisting grey hallways of the newly occupied government bunker that had been seized by the forces of the One Million Demons led by their venerable Demon King. His name was rarely spoken, and those who would find themselves slipping up on that issue would also find themselves missing a body part they most likely would have kept on their person. As the young man continued to ran he passed by the doctor's quarters, the place where many an eye or tongue was removed on the order of the Demon King. It was said to be staffed by a white man, but whatever he had done to be there or deserve his fate as doctor for the Demon army was none of the young man's business, after all he was in quite the hurry. He had been stationed at one of the scout posts that were hidden around the bunker site's rims, and he had spotted an advancing force of Qing forces around a mile or two away from his small underground hovel that was used to scout and ambush when possible. The young man himself wore a unique uniform, it was the Nationalist Army uniform dyed jet black, with a poorly crafted wooden mask of a Yaoguai and a thin patrol cap that had not actually been dyed yet, and so retained its former dark blue coloring. Despite the man's youth, his equipment was of a vastly better quality then the men around him, a sign of his favor and the "elite" nature of the Demon Scouts. Finally after a few more minutes of running around nearly empty hallways, as the units had been deployed to an operation earlier that day and only the garrison remained, the young man came up to the door of the Demon King. On the steel bunker door read the words "Any who come in here without good reason shall be damned by the power of the Demon King.", the man hoped that a possible impending attack was good enough to qualify as a good reason. He burst through the door into the room and saw one man standing in front of a large map of the surrounding area and a statue of one of the Chinese gods of Luck, defaced and scarred by what looked like bullets. The man wore a similar uniform to the young man, a Nationalist Army uniform that had been died black with a demon mask, although the mask was of much higher quality and was properly painted and laminated. The imposing figure turned himself and looked back at the young man, his sharp brown eyes gleeming from behind the mask. The young man blurted out what he could, telling of an impending attack and the Qing patrol. The man in the mask simply came up to the young man and patted him on the back, calming and comforting him, and told him only one thing."

crf.2.t:0 "Fire my Sweet"
crf.2.d:0 "Fire is the most honest and just thing there is in this rather wretched world, it, like death, does not discriminate in its consumption. Fire will burn you no matter your class and no matter your faith, it just consumes all that is organic around it, because it is true that it is fire that is the most just and holy. Orders from the Demon King have stated it simply, to do what is most just and holy we must consume that which is not holy with what is, and so we must burn the lands of our enemies. The bodies which splay themselves in front of their farms in terror are simply obstacles in divine justice, and they will be turned into crispy reminders of that fact if they dare come in the path of us, the demons. Fire is something that must be cultivated and loved, it is something that is a living thing and a fellow being that must be respected and understood if we, the demons of China, wish to ever come close to our namesake. We shall burn it all, burn all the lands our hands come in contact with, leaving only which land is useful to us virgin to the breathless agony of flames and our righteous pain. Now we understand that flames should not be used wildly and without responsibility, we must keep our bodies whole for the Demon King if we are going to win this war after all. So we have formed units which specialize in the application of fire and its use. These men have a great honor, for they are bestowed upon them with a large tank of gas, which is then piped and ignited by a simply lighter system, for many of these holy blowers of fire are handmade by the subjects of the Demon King. It is by this homemade nature that the fire Demons often burst into flames in a spectacular explosion, almost always on accident of course, which can put a dent in the manpower of the great Demon King. So as a response often only our youngest and most expendable soldiers are used, but in the end they are serving a purpose of holy and just fire that they may yet not understand at their young age. Once their spirit reaches adulthood, they could properly understand, and our Shamans and Priests have made sure to bless each exploded fire Demon who has died destroying the landscape of the enemy and transforming China into a more just land, resembling hell."

crf.3.t:0 "The Choice"
crf.3.d:0 "The Great Demon King has laid out his options on who he wishes to become his second in command, his master of spirits and souls, his general of demonkind. There are two men, both of whom have felt the tinges of hell on their asses and have come out of it with perspectives that match their monstrous exterior. The Demon General, his name having once been Zeng Kuoqing, is on one side of the isle. He has been constantly loyal to the Demon King and his will since the beginning, being a former General within the Army of the Republic of China, over time he had found Chiang to be too cowardly to be a proper leader. The moment that the Demon King had fled to the North to make his One Million Demons, the Demon General had followed him and been at his side. On the issue of personality he is bland, unoffensive, and entirely boring, all things that have made the Demon King seek any other possible choice. The Demon Doctor has been the other choice, a man with an unusual story that has been left in the past when it comes to the Demons. Some say that he is a white man from the west, while others say that is merely a ruse, and in reality he is the avatar of Pien Chueh or some Demon of Pain. Whatever he is, he is not simply unassuming or bland. The Doctor has been through agony, sheer agony, and his face is hidden behind a mask to make sure that no man would see him merely as a deformity or an abnormality. The Doctor seeks to heal China, he seeks progress and he seeks life, yet in his pursuit of life he has been driven mad by torture and the horrors of the Demon Army. So now the healer seeks to help the dealers of death kill so that he may have some form of peace. Regardless of all of that, the Demon King found him more interesting, which in reality was the only reason he had actually considered him in the first place. Both of the men had their benefits, the General would bring a relative stability to the Demon Army, something that the Demon King had been having difficulties with. As expected keeping an army of the uneducated, mentally ill, and rowdy tended to result in poor discipline and organization. The Doctor instead seeks to make the men masters of pain, and be able to take incredible punishment and then deal it our in equal spades. Either way, the Demon King made his choice..."

crf.4.t:0 "Education"
crf.4.d:0 "Why should we let the peasantry read or write? In our past the peasantry would simply labor, laying each stone to build the wall and each brick in every palace. These peasants do not have rights, that is the way as it was, peasants were to work and stay quiet. Communists have infiltrated our Peasant's minds, made them think in their folly that they should be able to state their opinions or have time off, but that is simple Utopianism, there is no world that is not filled with constant labor or with true social freedom. By embracing the death of Freedom and the only Freedom being death, the people of the world can finally come to peace without constant struggle or suffering, and bow to their elders. There is no future, there is no past, there is only the legacy of Kings and Emperors, Princes and Nobility. Whatever form that the Nobility take in history, they are the universal constant that binds humanity together, the glue of history, and societies that reject the objective hierarchy given to us by Heaven will end only in dust. The education of the peasantry and giving them breaks are a part of this rejection, the peasantry, in vein, attempting to improve their wretched fate which Heaven has bestowed upon them. They rebel by trying to educate themselves, by trying to form systems where they may have this false freedom created by the worst ignorances of humanity, and they try to make it so their believed children, their "future", will be able to understand the future and the past. We must kill this idea, and we must kill the people behind it, for in the thousands of years of enlightened history there has never been one philosopher, one thinker, or one worthwhile man that came from dirt. That is what the peasantry are, dirt, shit, the scum off my boots, and I will crush their hands when they ask for help. Without peasant literacy we come one step closer to finally destroying the peasant's spirit. "

crf.5.t:0 "Rumbling Below"
crf.5.d:0 "The Council of the Demon King sat around his throne in a near perfect circle, as by the King's instructions. The King was quite obsessive when it came to prophecy and magic, and to him the circle was the most holy symbol on the planet. The circle represented the nature of life and death, of society and nobles, constantly repeating and regurgitating the same points and the same men. The King knew which man he was in that circle of history, although he had kept that revelation from anybody else in his government. His councilmen were worried, not quite panicking yet, but on the verge of throwing their hands in the air and storming out of the room. Of course all of them knew that would be an instant call for the glory of death to sweep them up from the mortal plane, as the King always had a revolver on his desk for just such an occasion, but the temptation for cowardice remained. The reason for fear had come from the fact that a massive movement had been found amongst the soldiers of the Demon Army, headed by that damn doctor that the King had been so forceful in allowing to be in his cabinet despite clearly not being Han, let alone even Chinese. How could they restore the traditions of China if one of their leading members wasn't Chinese in the first place? Here they were paying for it, as the Doctor decided to form a small cult around his growing popularity within the Demon Army called the Society of Pien Chueh. Pien Chueh, being the god of healing, was an appropriate choice for the doctor on the surface of things, but in reality the man had been the unofficial torturer for the Demon Army since his forceful recruitment. At first the man had not taken to the task, being a soft man at heart and a healer above all, even with a gun to his head he refused to even tickle somebody without medical purpose. Many of the Demons had been ready to kill him right then and there, but instead they forced his hands to cut the throats of one hundred men, which quickly broke the doctor into a haze of unknowing. Since then he has been doing the torture willingly, all in the name of his now warped idea of what "Healing" is. Clearly this man and his society are a threat to the Demon Army, but the choice if his little cult should be suppressed or not was not the choice of the Council. The Demon King thought carefully and..."

crf.6.t:0 "A Man Amongst Monsters"
crf.6.d:0 "Norman hadn't wanted it to come to this, he had loved humanity since his first steps onto the world, and had always thought of the evils of man as being something that could be overcome. Norman now realized that his thinking had been flawed, oh so very flawed indeed. He was now in a foreign land, taking the blood of innocents at the beck and call of people who call themselves monsters and devils, and he could not oppose them. He had tried to get them to kill him, many times in fact, but they had only laughed at him and once again locked him in his padded cell that constituted his "room". He was trapped, trapped to kill and maim and to never heal another good man again. But as the only qualified doctor within the so called "Army" he now worked in, he had begun to build relations with the many people who served in it. Most of the soldiers were young, boys really, who had no place fighting or dying on the battlefield. Yet Norman and his small battalion of folk doctors were the only ones to heal their wounds, and Norman was the only doctor who actually did a damn thing for them. Eventually Norman began to hear whispers of his growing legend, the soldiers had begun to call him "Pien Chueh", the god of healing. Despite all the bleakness this reminder of his ability to help and heal brought some peace to his soul, it gave him the drive to continue his grisly work if only it meant to save more people. Then, one day, as Norman walked away from his operating table and the guards came to his side to escort him back to his cell, he saw a shrine right outside of his makeshift medical bay. It was a collection of flowers and bloody rags, alongside coins and prayers, and in the center of it was a painted portrait of Norman dressed as a Chinese god. The men had been worshipping him, there were hundreds of prayers in small envelopes with a coin inside, as per the tradition, all of it being dedicated to him. Norman was not a vain man, the fact that men were actually worshipping him as Pien Chueh horrified him beyond belief, but it also again built his soul up again from darkness. The next day as he treated his patients, he started talking as if he was the avatar of Pien Chueh, he spoke bombastically and told of how with his rule, China would heal from its many many wounds. Eventually there were no more guards, and he was appointed the second in command of the entire army, a decision which baffled Chueh, I mean Norman, but he would do with the same tenacity he always had."

crf.7.t:0 "Death against Life"
crf.7.d:0 "Wang laid on the operating table in a field hospital, he couldn't remember where exactly he had been fighting, but by this point it probably didn't matter. Death had seen him by now, and it was only a matter of time before the wretched bitch would take him to hell with the other demons that had fallen in battle. Wang tried to act tough, the entire point of joining this damn army was to die after all, he couldn't be a pussy when his time came and he entered the underworld. But Wang was also a 15 year old peasant from Shanxi who had never seen much more then his village in his whole life, and his capacity to handle such raging emotions was not that of a experienced soldier. So he began to cry, he cried in the face of death and his own mortality, because he knew he was nothing but a coward and a child, he was not ready for any of this, he wanted to see his parents again, he wanted to feel their warm embrace and love again. He knew he couldn't, he was going to die on a dirty steel bed waiting on a doctor who would never come, and he was going to be damned and would never see his parents ever again. Wang prayed to the only thing he knew could help him, Pien Chueh, the god of healing, was said to have an avatar within the army. He prayed with all his might, with the power of his tears and his blood, and with the core of his very soul. Please, I just want to live to see my parents again, I want to live to have a girlfriend and a wife, maybe even a child, please Pien Chueh I beg of you. Suddenly a figure appeared over his blurred vision, it was a white man in a white hooded robe followed by several young men. The man spoke to the young men about the condition of Wang, and how to heal his injuries if possible. He then began to give a demonstration using Wang as the guinea pig. The operation was painful, his skin and flesh writhed in agony, but he was practically paralyzed and could not even flinch, which was to the benefit of the hooded man. Eventually Wang passed out, to him another sign of his cowardice, and he felt the inky blackness take over him. He knew it, this was death, he had died and he was stuck forever in this inky blackness. Then, light, as Wang awoke he sat up, the pain was acute but he was able to sit, and he saw where he was. He was in recovery, he had been saved by Pien Chueh and his Avatar. Later that day another offering was placed on the altar of Pien Chueh, and another life was saved."
