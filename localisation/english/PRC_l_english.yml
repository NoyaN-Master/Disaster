prc.1.t:0 "One Thousand Pedals"
prc.1.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instance, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China. The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"

prc.2.t:0 "Polycephaly"
prc.2.d:0 "Mao and Deng had both become the principle leaders of the Chinese Socialist and Communist movement ever since the assassination of Wang and the destruction of the official Communist party of China, which had been brutally raided and destroyed by Chiang after he somehow managed to blame the Communists for killing their number one ally. Both of them were however on opposite ends of the political spectrum within the party as well as on oppose ends of education when it came to politics. Deng had written and wrote Marxist theory before the Wang incident, and was well educated in the ways of politics and economics, as well as in theory ranging from Fascism to Marxism. Personally Deng identified himself as an Orthodox Marxist or a "True" Marxist, believing that in order for socialism to be possible the material conditions must be met, and by that logic those same material conditions must be accelerated in China. In practice Deng did not act much like a socialist, instead supporting a state capitalist economy with heavy elements of corporatism and economic planning, but his views were popular with the intelligentsia, urban population, as well as the far left and right wing of the party. Mao was in many ways the antithesis, Mao had never actually read any Marxist theory before, using most of his time as a librarian and then further on a master of records to study the culture of China versus the West and military theory. To Mao socialism was achievable through the use of communal democracy and the decentralization of the state, taking influence from the Chinese Anarchists who Mao had interacted with earlier in his youth. Mao technically considered himself a Marxist, but most often simply referred to himself as a Chinese Socialist or a Chinese Communist, neither of which especially fit his viewpoints. Mao is popular with the left and center of the party, as well as the massive peasant population of China and anti-traditionalist activists."

prc.3.t:0 "On the Issue of Culture"
prc.3.d:0 "Mao and Deng both were not a fan of the more conservative aspects of Chinese society. However experience and life had led Mao to follow a much more radical path against the tradition he saw as gnawing on the bones of Chinese society. Thousands of years of "civilization", all of which had led to a brutal monarchy and foot binding, the rape of wives and the beating of children, to Mao this only proved that the past as it was should die, and in front of it a new revolutionary culture should form. Deng as befitting his more scholarly disposition was not about to allow the destruction of the past to take place. Deng did in fact support women's rights and believed in many of the same things, but he also understood that without the traditions of China to hold it together as a base, China would not remain intact. So to Deng Chinese society must be reformed, its past used to create a new progressive China, the traditions purged of their nastiness and replaced by clean versions of them. Further on from this Mao was completely against religion, believing it to be one of the classical evils that had plagued China and prevented it from moving forward into the future. As expected, Deng took a more moderate and pragmatic path, believing that although religion has many negative aspects, it can have positives as well, and should generally be tolerated in its existence."

prc.4.t:0 "On The Issue of Industry"
prc.4.d:0 "As soon as the party came together, all individuals involved understood there would be disagreements. It was a group of communists and socialists after all, and as the saying goes if you leave a group of communists in a room with a question and a gun, only one man is coming out of there alive. As the guerrilla movement shifted itself into a proper provisional revolutionary government, actually controlling land and managing it in a realistic sense, these questions became more then petty political arguments. So in the grand tradition of Communist movements, the issues on which direction the party would take would be dept with open democratic debate following by adherence to the party line. The first debate was on the issue of industry, and how it would be treated under the current provisional revolutionary government. Mao and his faction shot out with an argument detailing the benefits of a fully nationalized system ran in communal industrial sectors, essentially centralizing industry into what amounted to industrial communes or collectives. Mao stated that by doing so the Chinese people would be able to work in conditions familiar to them as former communal farmers, while also bringing the benefit of greater living standards to the workers themselves, as well as greater workplace democracy due to the communal organization of it. Deng snapped back, pointing out that communes were great and all but without proper direction from above, many factories would fail to organize and would instead slowly devolve into the same feudal system that had plagued China for centuries. Instead, they should organize the factories through state owned and directed corporations, with Deng highlighting the fact that China should develop capitalism before it could develop anything close to socialism. Deng stated the benefits would be vastly greater economic efficiency as well as the growth of state held capital allowing for superior industrial development. The two sides bickered for hours until finally a solution was met... "

prc.4.b:0 "We shall form State Corporations, the material conditions must prior be met."

prc.5.t:0 "On The Issue of Agriculture"
prc.5.d:0 "Deng and Mao continued to scream at each other for hours on the party congress floor, which had become a daily event in the region owned by the socialist revolutionaries. Insults were flung constantly, from "Revisionist" to "Class Traitor" to "Utopian" and "Left Communist", neither side seemed to have any inclination of stopping any time soon. The current issue on the floor was the issue of agriculture in China, this is something that both sides had rather extremely different perspectives on, and neither side was budging. Mao gave his speech one more time, citing the absolutely essential nature that the communalization of agriculture posed. By communalizing agriculture the peasants of China could acquire more rights then they had ever had before, being largely self sufficient, and would allow for the rural regions of China to have a large surplus of agricultural goods. These improvements in standards of living in rural regions would increase the population at a faster rate by allowing greater leisure time for the farmers to pursue education and family life. Deng, on the other hand, argued for the the "soft" collectivization of agriculture, allowing some private farms while also having massive centralized farming collectives to produce as much food as possible. Deng understood that this would not exactly be an improvement of the rights of the Chinese peasantry, but in the long term it would allow for the abolition of the Chinese peasantry as a class, in the end only having industrial farms that would only require a very small farmer population. Deng also shot back at Mao, saying his plan would ignore the all important Urban centers and leave China undeveloped. After a few more hours of argumentation, an agreement was reached..."

prc.5.b:0 "The Peasantry shall work in centralized farming groups that sell their goods on the market."

prc.6.t:0 "On The Issue of Government"
prc.6.d:0 "Mao and Deng once again sat at opposing ends of the party congress, arguing their case to the greater party membership. The current issue on the floor was a big one, how should the post-war government be organized and what should the power of the leadership be? The two factions once again rose from their seats and began to scream at each other insistently, with the two cases being presented in a rough but effective manner. Mao declared that the government should be organized as, like most other things in Mao's ideal state, communally. Following the Russian example of "Soviets", the government would be a series of democratically elected councils until finally reaching the Grand Council, which would be the primary organ of the state. The higher leadership of China such as Mao himself would act as guidance and advisers as part of the higher party congress, but would not interfere with the machinations of the Grand Council and it's political decisions. Deng said that this system would only breed corruption like so many of Mao's ideas before, and that instead the party should look to the American system for inspiration. There should be a President of China with broad executive powers, as well as the party congress becoming the national congress, organized on the same lines but functioning as the primary machine of the state. A senate would be created to confirm the actions of the congress, and a supreme court would be used to settle judicial manners. Of course this system would be more socialistic then the American system, with lobbying and other such elements of corruption being abolish, but this system in the eyes of Deng would allow China to once again be stable and whole."

As the final votes were announced the room fell silent, and then burst into a violent mash of cheers and jeers. Mao Zedong had won the election and was established as the Temporary President, and would act as the face of the party and it's head ideologue until a proper election could be held after the war had ended. Mao and his supporters were enthusiastic, the peasantry would finally have their rights, there would be no more landlords to oppress them from above. The peasantry would be allowed to maintain their autonomy with Mao's communes and councils, and they would be able to directly cast their vote on local issues as well as issues of the state. His opposition, however, were not as enthusiastic, for there was a darker side to all of this. Mao often ignored what proper policy to take in respect to Urbanization and public infrastructure and transport, and many worried that with him in power, these areas would be all but ignored development wise. Sure the peasants might be free, but their freedom would be at the cost of the growing Chinese middle and urban class, as well as the intelligentsia. Still, as the peasantry made up the majority of the population, and so the majority of the population within the socialist borders celebrated and drank and were merry. Mao personally celebrated his victory in a much more sober and subdued way, drinking cheap rice wine in his study as he drew up his plans and strategies for the coming campaign. This new power would not just be sat on, Mao would make sure that the people of China would never have to suffer under a dictator again, and that no matter what they would be free to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

prc.8.d:0 "The party congress had held its breath, the election ballets had come in for who would be the new Temporary President of the socialist movement and the party. As the final votes were announced the room fell silent, and then burst into a violent mash of cheers and jeers. Deng Xiaoping had won the election and was established as the Temporary president, and would act as the face of the party and it's head ideologue until a proper election could be held after the war had ended. Deng and his supporters celebrated, China would know progress as the factories and infrastructure would spring up from every corner and plain, and the people of China would find their living standards improve as rapid a rate as possible. The Peasantry grumbled, they had not put their support behind the Socialists just for another tinpot dictator to think he could change the Chinese way of life. Urbanization was, to them, a western way and western ways should stay with western men, far away from China. Deng and his supporters of course tried to convince the peasantry otherwise, showing them the wonders that this progressive attitude could bring, but all that ended up doing in the end was further alienating the peasantry from Deng. They did not want economic progress or factories, they wanted no landlords and cultural change, they did not want to have to wait to transition, they wanted Socialism now. Despite these complaints the intelligentsia and urban population celebrated with their imported liquor and beer. Deng however celebrated without drinking at all, preferring to again bury himself in his many books in his library. The studying was an absolute necessity for what he had planned, as Deng had a grand offensive in the works, and he was not going to let a misplaced hill ruin his entire plan. His newfound power was not exactly enough, but it did allow for Deng to further what he needed to do to modernize China."

prc.9.t:0 "On Guerrilla Warfare"
prc.9.d:0 "Mao's education in the ways of war was not a conventional one. During the long rebellion against Imperial rule he had been merely a conscript within the Anti-Imperial forces, until one day when his force had been ambushed by Qing Cavalry. Although the days of Cavalry had long since passed in the brutal fires of the Great War, the horsemen had waited until the precise perfect moment and completely shattered the marching line of the infantry. The battle was short, but Mao managed to crawl away from the fighting in a bush along with around 20 other men who had survived the raid. All of them knew that they would be unable to pass back into their own lines due to the advance the cavalry had signalled, but they thought of another way they could continue the war effort behind the lines. Through trial and a lot of error Mao managed to lead his small raggedy group into being a legitimate Guerrilla force which grew every month with the support of the peasants in the surrounding area. It was from this experience that Mao came to the conclusion that modern warfare was a Protracted Warfare, not massive lines of men fighting one another but loose groups wrecking chaos behind the lines while conventional forces smashed the front. Now that Mao was a leader of a resistance movement, his knowledge of guerrilla warfare and gaining the will of the people would prove invaluable. To Mao, it is always better to lose land then to lose guns and men, but to also make your enemy pay dearly for every single inch of ground they take. Flanking and ambushes are also essential, and all the elements of this come together to form what Mao calls "Protracted People's War". Popular support forms the foundation of all of this, because without the people a war cannot be fought, but ith the will and support of the people, any war is winnable. "

prc.10.t:0 "The New War"
prc.10.d:0 "Deng, unlike Mao, was a properly educated man. He had studied military strategy and the Great war religiously in his youth and in his adulthood, trying to find whatever he could to be used as a tool against his enemies. The central observation that could be gleamed from the great war was the essentially nature of combined arms warfare as well as the necessity of speed and mobility in all armed forces. The men should be able to appear anywhere they would be needed, and with the power of heavy guns and tanks they could shred all those who stood in their way. Deng had studied in Germany for a few short years long ago, and while he was there he had picked up on the concept of a new type of war, a war that was based on that exact same mobility that Deng had so craved. The word used was one of those rather silly German words which Deng had come to love despite all of its crudeness and inelegance. He had of course been the first one to translate the concept of this German "Blitzkrieg" into Chinese, and he had called it Shanjizhan, it meant the same thing but it had a nice ring to it either way. The men would be trained in the greatest of discipline, they would force their ways forwards through weak points in the enemy's line and surround them, leaving them out of supply and trapped in a bubble of steel and blood. Deng would ideally try to import any tanks and armoured cars he could, perhaps he could even set up a factory in China based on some of the German designs that had been trickling to him from his contacts in the NGPU. His style of warfare didn't have all the style nor propaganda value of Mao's "People's War", but it would win them the damn war no matter if they wanted it to or not. Tanks and Trucks, those were the future, and Deng was going to see to it that China had the industrial might and the will to make sure it was not behind in the game."

prc.11.t:0 "A Secret Message to the Jade Throne"
prc.11.d:0 "Puyi paced around his 5th bedroom, it was his favorite as its unusual L shape broke up the boredom and regularity of most of the other rooms within the palace. This palace was a place that Puyi had not been since he was a small boy, but there was no more perverted maids or devious teachers to chastise and torture his every waking moment. On his tea table was a letter that had been placed carefully underneath his tea set, a tea set Puyi was not actually sure of how to operate, and was addressed direct to him. In his life Puyi had read any of the small scraps of information he could, may it be letters or old books or whatever else was available. The Emperor was generally forbidden from reading except the Chinese Classics, although his tutor when he was a child had been kind enough to supply him with a copy of Alice in Wonderland, a book that had deeply inspired him despite its strangeness. He sat before the tea table in a manner that had been beaten into his head time and time again and gracefully opened the letter with his letter opener. Reading over the words confused Puyi, because although the letter was written in a satisfactory manner its content was of no logical content. It was written by a leader of the "Socialists", a group name that Puyi had hear before but had little education in the nature of. All of his tutors and educators had always said that the "Socialists" were a group of western demons, but this was clearly written by an educated Chinese man, with the name of "Deng Xiaoping". Puyi suspected, like many of the things he had learned in recent times, his tutors had lied to him to make yet another group of innocent people seem evil just to control him. Reading through the letter again, it appeared as if the "Socialists" were asking for a ceasefire between the Qing Empire and their state, and for the potential for a possible future alliance against the forces of Chiang and Dai Li. Those words were enough to swing the young Emperor in favor of supporting this agreement between two gentlemen, as those names had been burnt into his mind from nothing but their horrible atrocities and crimes. Puyi found a piece of Imperial paper and was about to send for a servant to write a letter for him, but then he paused. He decided that it would be best to practice his characters and statesmanship, and use this opportunity to show off how much he had progressed. After a few hours of writing, Puyi sent for a Imperial Messenger to send this message to the gentleman Deng Xiaoping. Hopefully he would hear from him soon."
prc.11.a:0 "Through a minor miracle, the letter makes it to Deng's desk."
prc.11.b:0 "The messenger is shot and the letter never makes it to Deng."

prc.12.t:0 "The Strangest Proposal In History"
prc.12.d:0 "Deng honestly could not believe the letter that sat on his desk, but it clearly sat there, insulting him and staring back at him with its mere presence. It had come from a spy Deng had planted inside the Qing a few weeks earlier in an attempt to poke out logistical and political weaknesses within the state, and his spy had found out two central things. The Qing were almost entirely militarily reliant on Japanese equipment and arms, often the equipment would simply have the Japanese proof marks and symbols crudely painted over or scratched out by company quartermasters. Secondly, the Emperor Puyi absolutely and unequivocally hated his current position as Emperor. The man, from what the spy had written, was in fact a rather gentle soul, unsuited to warfare or in honesty governance at all. He was living the life of a monarch but all evidence suggested his heart bled for the actions done in his name. Importantly, the spy had been posing as a eunuch within the recently reoccupied Forbidden City palace Puyi had been staying at, and he had heard the Emperor lament the situation of the civil war. He had verbally decried the Demon Dai Li and the bastard Chiang, and had implied that an ally, any ally, would be preferable to having to bend his people's knee to those bloodthirsty monsters and traitorous snakes. The spy had sensed potential in that sentiment and sent Deng authorization to send Puyi a letter stating interest in forming a non-aggression pact between the two waring states. Deng had thought nothing of it, although it was probably destined to fail there was no point in not at least trying, or using any help they could get. So the letter had been sent, and now, the response had come directly to Deng himself. It was a letter in gold imperial leaf paper and black ink, decorated as if it was going to be sent to a fellow king rather then a communist rebel. Puyi's response was simple, or at least as simple as any imperial message can be with all of its poetics and long statements. Puyi was interested in pursuing dialog with the Communists, and with the promise of the Emperor stated his soldiers would no longer fire upon Communist forces as long as the Communists did the same. This had not been what Deng had expected to find on his desk, but ever the pragmatist he understood good news when he saw it."

prc.13.t:0 "The Fox and the Swan"
prc.13.d:0 "After Deng had notified Mao of what had happened in relation to Puyi, well Mao was shocked, yes, but also a little bit furious. Mao yelled as he usually did, saying that Deng had betrayed the revolution and that we was a Revisionist and that he would never in his life side with a noble let alone an Emperor. Deng was insistent however, one less front to worry about was thousands less dead on their part, and it wasn't as if they couldn't just absorb or conquer Puyi after the war anyways. Deng, sensing another implosion, shut Mao down before he even started and recommended that he actually go and meet the Emperor. They needed somebody there to negotiate after all, and Deng was currently too busy organizing factory production to actually go there. Mao grumbled and mumbled, but he wasn't an idiot, and so he and a small squad of Guerrillas sneaked their way into Beijing to meet the Emperor. Once they got to the city they were stopped by the Imperial Guard who guarded it, but Mao presented the letter from Puyi and told him that the Communists and the Qing were now at the very least not enemies. The guard flinched, but he did not argue with the rag tag band of peasants in military greys and blues and said they would be able to request an escort at the guard barracks, as was proper when meeting royalty. The scene was almost comical, the "Great Peasant Lord Mao" as the imperial crier titled him walked up the steps of the Imperial palace in his dirty light blue uniform, flanked by his similarly dressed men and women soldiers and Imperial Guards in their shining gold inlaid uniforms. The door men bowed as Mao and his entourage entered the massive building, a gesture Mao and his soldiers did not return much to the chagrin of all those present. On the far end of the room there was a massive golden and jade throne, flanked on all sides by advisers and servants of all shapes and sizes. The man on the throne, unlike his servants, did not wince when Mao forgot to bow, and, when he finally did, did so in a sloppy and untrained manner. He was a thin and smaller man in glasses, unassuming if it was not that he was the Emperor. He stared at Mao and, to the shock of all those present, walked down from his throne to greet him. Throughout the coming negotiations Mao realized that despite his faults, he rather came to like the little man. Best of all, he was very receptive towards not only being an ally, but being absorbed by the Communists outright!"

prc.14.t:0 "An Unholy Agreement"
prc.14.d:0 "Mao and Puyi sat across from each other in the Emperor's third tea room, which was of course his favorite. The two had come to bond over the days spent in each others company, much to the shock and awe of both Mao's Guerrillas and Puyi's Imperial Guard. It was in fact through this shock that the Guerrillas and the Imperial Guard had managed to start a dialogue between each other, and over the days the two groups had found much in common in their service and their core philosophies, even if they were radically different in many other ways. In fact as the final meeting between the Fox and the Swan was underway, the two groups were outside smoking cigarettes and playing cards. As Mao and Puyi sit and sipped tea, the two read over the argument the states had come to, despite the treaty being mutually agreeable both sides wanted to make sure there were no extra caveats. Puyi and the Qing would be absorbed into the true Chinese Republic, with the guarantee that the Manchu would be treated with equality and respect, that the banners would be maintained, and that Puyi would continue as the Emperor of China in a ceremonial capacity. Although Puyi had not wanted it, he had been pressured by advisers to secure himself a vague position within the government of the Socialists, to maintain political relevance and social status among the people of China. Mao had uncharacteristically agreed to these concessions, but the considerable pressure from Deng and his faction as well as the budding friendship he now had with Puyi, it was very difficult for him not to accept the conditions as they were presented. The idea of Monarchy disgusted Mao, but perhaps it was to be that the material conditions would have to fade away by themselves rather then be brutally suppressed. Even considering that Deng was right about something disgusted Mao, but considering the situation he was in there was not much he could use to cope with that very probable fact. Later that day the agreement was signed by both parties and ratified by the Imperial Court and the Party Congress, both of which were utterly confused by the message but never the less accepting of the situation that had been presented before them. It was now official, the Qing were now fighting alongside the Socialists, an unholy alliance indeed!"

prc.15.t:0 "The People's Emperor"
prc.15.d:0 "The propaganda posters lined the walls of every socialist owned settlement in China, the Communists had made sure to make a printing press of of their first things they would pilfer and requisition from every place they could. The poster was in a style familiar to most Chinese, it was black and white with tinges of red and used harsh black lines in the style of a character brush. On the edges it had a variety of Chinese people, workers, farmers, soldiers, even a few Qing bannermen, and in the center it had a large drawing of Puyi's face. On the top and bottom was the line: "Be like selfless Like Puyi, be heroic even when it means less for you!". It was clear that the socialists had seen the propaganda value in having the Emperor willingly having given up his Empire in the name of the people, or at least that is who he had done it for at least. Like many of the other revolutionary martyrs and heroes Puyi would become a commonly discussed name in classrooms and party meetings, the man who had sacrificed everything for everyone, the People's Emperor. Of course Puyi was slightly uncomfortable with how well the Chinese Socialists had managed to turn around what had at first been seen as a revisionist and sacrilegious act, but he did not question it. He had been given the rather daunting job as the minster of Public Enlightenment, but in reality the job turned out to be quite simple. He would appear in propaganda and oversee its production, and when he saw something he didn't like he wouldn't approve it, and when he saw something he did like he would approve it. He even got plenty of time off to be able to garden, a hobby he had picked up long ago, and his flowers had been coming in quite nicely. Although he had nowhere near the power he once had, Puyi felt happy for once in his life. He of course had to learn many basic things like how to brush his teeth and how to put on clothes, but for once in his life he was truly independent. He had gone from an article of hatred by most to a figurehead. Now was he a figurehead of a movement that had deposed him in the first place? Yes he was, but he was also the figurehead of a movement that treated him as more then just another political pawn, if only by a little. He knew his place and his purpose, and he would live up to his title as the People's Emperor. "

prc.16.d:0 "The Qing banners had been an issue for the Socialists ever since they had signed the agreement which promised them that their position would be maintained. The banners had been used as a simple manpower pool at first, but this had caused resentment as the bannermen declared that they were more then just normal peasants, and that they had been tried as one unit, not individuals. The Socialist generals had grit their teeth, but a solution did finally present itself, although not without issue and definitely not without a significant amount of arguing. They would reorganize the banners into their original units, under their original officers and original organization, they would be used as an elite section of the infantry and shock troops, hitting hard against the enemies of the Red Army. The maintenance of loyalty was another difficulty entirely however, as the bannermen refused to serve under the banner of the red army. Another compromise soon find itself on the floor however, and it was proposed that the Banners would be fighting for the Emperor Puyi, and that the Emperor Puyi had attached them to the Red Army as an Imperial ally. They were told that since they were of such elite status, they should care and train the other peasant soldiers so that they would too be able to serve the Emperor by serving the Red Army, which was a logical twist of twine that the bannermen in their average intelligence accepted. In quite a comedic fashion these golden guards of the Emperor would march into battle with their Qing Banners flying proudly alongside a Communist style flag of Puyi's likeness, and they would fight and die alongside the peasantry which had not so long ago been fighting against them. Whatever their foibles however, the Banners are some of the best trained soldiers in China, and with their training and units the Red Army has found itself with a considerable boost in ability."

prc.17.t:0 "Claiming the Mandate"
prc.17.d:0 "TBThe Socialists were pragmatic when it came down to it. Although Mao and his faction put themselves as idealist revolutionaries as much as they could, in reality they would often do what needed to be done to further the cause. The Socialists were often proud of this pragmatism, it had allowed them to have much influence during the time of Wang, and it was further this pragmatism that was allowing them to sit, during a war and be sure they could win it. The question of the Monarchists and the Imperial identity had been one thrown around the party congress ever since it had been founded, and the general party line had been one of labelling the Monarchists simply "Reactionaries". However, in no small part under the influence of Deng, the Imperialists had began to find themselves more favor as the "People's Emperor" Puyi had come to the Socialist side and put his effort behind them. In the party there had begun a new consensus, and it was thus; the Imperialists were a revolutionary people who had been misguided by reactionary lies to put their faith in hereditary power, but they had also opposed the nationalist and the evil and most unjust foreign imperialist. It was by such that the idea of the mandate of heaven has been recognized to hold significant value over the culture and belief of the Chinese people, and so as a just government they would comfort the people by embracing the past while also looking towards the future. From this end, the Socialists have put forward and claimed the Mandate of Heaven, seeing to it that the cultural Chinese idea of heaven embraces the Socialists and recognizes the validity of their power and claim. When many of the more traditional and hardcore of the Monarchists heard of this, they were enraged. How dare these peasants claim what was not justly theirs, their position should not allow them any form of legitimacy in the eyes of China! But the common Monarchist saw it differently, had not the Yellow Turbans claimed the mandate of heaven despite being mere peasants? Had not the Chinese Christian rebels also preached the equality of man and claimed the Mandate as well? In fact was it not tradition that the rebels of society should rise to be Emperor? To the youth who had fallen in line with the Puyi, they had found their answer, and so they raised the red banner and the Qing dragon together, for they were fighting for the true Emperor and his true Empire, and Empire of the People and for the People!D"

prc.18.d:0 "The two officers stood guard across from each other on the quiet temple grounds, inside there was a meeting between the town council and one of the Socialist Civil Commissar. The meeting had been on the issue of a recent Nationalist raid that had struck the town's grain reserves, and the town had requested access to government stores of grain to supplement their depleted supply. The Civil Commissar took his leave and bowed, indicating for the two guards to follow him as they slowly left the village. "I don't like this one bit" the officer dressed in gold replied, "these people have lost their grain yet they do not ask for our protection, the Emperor's protection!" the officer in light blue next to him scoffed, "You mean the party's protection comrade, even the Emperor is a member of it.". The Qing Officer snickered but said nothing, in truth he respected the sentiment of the Communist Officer's statement, even if he did not agree with the content or the volume of the words spoken. The two men had been assigned together as part of the government's new program in promoting comradeship between the new two officer forces within the army, and despite many hurdles it had ended up being a decent success. The two men, through sweat and blood and battle, had ended up becoming friends, and had found out that despite what they may have thought earlier, they were both fighting for the same reason. They both had family at risk, and they were not about to let Chiang and his butchers destroy what they had fought so hard to protect. Suddenly the Commissar stopped and pulled the two men into a ditch beside a dirt road leaving the town. The two men did not understand until they saw the banner and line of men approaching. It was a nationalist group of about 20 men, each of them armed with low quality uniforms and guns. By their stance and march they were a disorganized group, probably made up of looters who were going to try and sack the village, viewing it as "easy prey". The two officers, both trained in guerrilla warfare, understood what they must do to protect the people. Their guns lit up the road, and they began to fight the rapists and thieves that would dare to harm the people of China. They were the new heroes of a new China, and despite their strange origin the two groups would find each others as brothers."
