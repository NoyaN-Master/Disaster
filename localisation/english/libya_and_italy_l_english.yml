 TIT_Forgotten_Colony_desc:0 "Italy, our beloved homeland has for all intents and purposes forgotten us. There was a time when the coasts of Anatolia were filled with Italian beauties here on a tourist trap disguised as a functioning colony, and our garrison was just a whole bunch of baby-faced recruits fresh out of boot camp hitting on those aforementioned beauties, but those times have long since passed. Due to the Italian civil war and economic downturn caused by the collapse of the united states, our once prosperous tourism industry collapsed. Since the colony couldn't run on bananas alone a new source of income was gravely needed. With our homeland in political turmoil and the colony bleeding cash, an "unusual" source of income was founded by the then newly appointed governor-general Mario Roatta. Ever since Roatta's appointment the colony has been turning a profit despite the lack of tourism, and while it is difficult to explain why there are so many ghost towns, and why Turkish guerilla fighters have increased exponentially under Roatta, as long as nothing major happens and the colony keeps turning a profit our homeland will continue to live in blissful ignorance"
 TIT_Legacy_Rhodes_desc:0 "Our army and officials need morale and inspiration to run this hellhole. We look back to our past, and to the Knights of Rhodes, the proud knights that safeguarded Christ's reign in Smyrna and Rhodes until the vicious, barbaric Turks came and pillaged them. Now 400 or so years after the turk despoiled the holy lands of Christendom, we have arrived. And it's due time for the turks to reap what they sowed all those years ago"
 tit.1.t:0 "A Quiet Morning"
 tit.1.d:0 "Our leader Mario roatta was going through a rather uneventful day, not unlike every other day he's had ever since he was appointed to rule over the abominable turks. he was skimming over reports from his officers and paperwork from his underlings like usual "region pacified", "about 200 hundred casualties" "a small increase in ambushes by partisan forces" nothing seemed out of place, because it was as dull as these reports always are. but unlike most days his fan had decided to malfunction and keep bothering him by constantly clicking which was starting to get on his nerves."

 tit.2.t:0 "An Explosive Afteroon"
 tit.2.d:0 ""Smoke. Tonnes of smoke. Heat. Fire." he thought as he slowly opened his eyes and sat upright, one moment he was leaving his office to go to his garden, the next he was at the ground with a hole where his office used to be. "Damn it all!" he yelled out. "what kind of fan would fucking tick!" as some guards rushed to him all roatta could do was to sit there and wait as his fury against the turks who did this ate him away from the inside"

 tit.4.t:0 "A Telegram From Rome"
