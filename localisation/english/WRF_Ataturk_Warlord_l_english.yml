wrf.18.t:0 "Manisa Congress"
wrf.18.d:0 "Today the Kemalist establishment hosted the Manisa Congress, where plans for the nation's future were fabricated and advised to the pashas. The main sides were the Kemalist and Linguist fronts that collided and were hostile against eachother. The Kemalists wanted an autarky, the principles of the Pasha, civil nationalism, secularism and many more ideals influenced by the French Revolution meanwhile the Linguists were full on war economists, ethnic supremacists, atheists and young, unruly men with dreams. The Pasha has talked with Nihal Atsız, the young leader of the bunch, and warned him of his malicious ideals, sparking the flame inside Atsız's heart against Kemal once more."
wrf.18.a:0 "To a great future, Kemalism is the way!"
wrf.18.b:0 "Surely this young men have went throught the suffering of the war..."
wrf.9.t:0 "Operation Lydias"
wrf.9.d:0 "Around 3 in the morning, a group of Turkish scouts, namely Coşkun, Osman and Tuğra, have infiltrated the casinos and rusty villages of coastal Antalya in our name, and they have photographed the terrorism and opression the Italian brigade is applying against the Turkish populace in the region. One of the leaders of the local freedom fighters, Şevket Süreyya, has aided us to get through the harshly checked borders and sketchy traps. With these photographs and interviews, we can easily apply for a receipt to the Italian government who already want to get rid of Roatta."
wrf.9.a:0 "Tell the scout folk that they have done well. "
wrf.11.t:0 "Peker in Rome"
wrf.11.d:0 "Recep Peker has met the diplomatic protocol of the Italian dictator D'Annunzio. Being a fan of the Futurist Italian Fascist movement, Peker has been keeping detailed summaries of the city of Rome and Florence which he visited before moving to Rome. Peker has compromised to the Italian statesman, namely Benito Mussolini, that upon annexation of the colony, Kemalist Turkey will be a close ally to Fascist Italy and back up eachother in dire times. Mr.Mussolini has also added that, in case of an invasion of Greece, the country will be divided between Italy and Turkey. Peker is now back on his way to Bursa, and his documentations of Italy may help Kemalist governence."
wrf.11.a:0 "Another victory for the true cause."
wrf.27.t:0 "Kuvay-i Milliye Defects to Us"
wrf.27.d:0 "One of our most known and skilled marshalls, Fevzi Çakmak, was stationed in Adana as the commander of the militant Kuvay-i Milliye forces and he has now decided to absorb his band of warriors and authority into our central one upon the annexation of Antalya by us which have created a supply line and a land border to the city of Adana"
wrf.27.a:0 "Come aboard, captain!"
wrf.29.t:0 "The Greeks Surrender!"
wrf.29.d:0 "Upon our triumph in the battle of Smyrna, the foolish Greek government has replied positively to our call for peace. According to our paper, the city of Smyrna will be given to our authority and sovereignity meanwhile the Greeks will pull out their paramilitary and terrorist men that endanger our people's lives there. We have also stated that the military academy in Smyrna will also be absorbed by us again, leaving them no international loopholes to take adventage of. Ismet Pasha's Kuvay-i Milliye regiment in Edirne has also joined us since the sea ways are now clear from Greek bombers, This is the revenge of 1926! "
wrf.31.t:0 "Setting up The Assembly"
wrf.31.d:0 "Bursa is the most developed city in Western Anatolia alongside with Smyrna, so we have created the Assembly in our new capital, Bursa. The Assembly will now be reformatted to represent the major faction in it's politics."
wrf.31.a:0 "Now we wait."
wrf.32.t:0 "Linguists hold a majority!"
wrf.32.d:0 "It has came to our attention that the Linguists and Nihal Atsız hold the most seats in our Assembly! Is this a new wave of totalitarian terror and death of liberation, or is it a great rebirth of a nation and it's warrior spirit? Time will tell."
wrf.32.a:0 "This must be stopped."
wrf.34.t:0 "Kemalists hold a majority"
wrf.34.d:0 "We as the Kemalist establishment have defeated the Linguists and consolidated our men in the Assembly. No one can dare challenge the Pasha!"
wrf.34.a:0 "We move east!"
wrf.29.a:0 "The West is Red."
wrf.35.t:0 "Linguists March in Smyrna"
wrf.35.d:0 "The Black Kemalists, a fraction of Linguists from the Izmir military academy, is now celebrating the victory in the Smyrnan war but pushing their political agenda and creating riots and hostility in the city. We are afraid that this unrest can spread to other cities including Bursa and Antalya. The armed forces has been mobilized to fight any Linguist uprising."
wrf.35.a:0 "Those dogs will be stopped."
wrf.36.t:0 "Secret Weapon Stash found in Bursa"
wrf.36.d:0 "Upon shocking news, our infiltrators in Linguist ranks have reported on their radios that they have found secret weapon stashes with the insignia of Enverist Armed Organization, paramilitary arm of Enver Pasha. They report that the weapons are basic rifles, bombs and interestingly, Tachanka machine gunned cars that have been imported from Makhnovia. This is an issue of national emergency, my Pasha."
wrf.36.a:0 "Tell Fevzi and his men to guard to streets! This is getting out of hand!"
wrf.37.t:0 "Occupation of Smyrna Academia"
wrf.37.d:0 "The Linguists have occupied the university in Smyrna! The local Greek populace have ran flocking to the sea, seeking transport to go back to their own country, otherwise they will be slaughtered! The Kemalist Youth Wing members have been brutalized and hanged all around the city and with the university, the main academic and civil center of the city, occupied by the Linguists, we have no chance but to go there as the entire Kemalist pasha circle and put an end to this!"
wrf.37.a:0 "I am coming too, Ismet!"
wrf.38.t:0 "The Kemalist Pashas are DEAD!"
wrf.38.d:0 "After  gruesome and costly guerilla warfare, the National Guard has decided to breach the occupied forts and university with a direct attack meanwhile raining it with artillery shells. \n This homever, did not go as planned. Mustafa Kemal Pasha and Ismet Pasha now lie dead with the Kemalist dream shattered.\n Forces of the pashas have flocked to the Linguist side and the other generals were already spies all along or now forced to work for the Linguists via force. Upon hearing the news of Kemalist defeat in Smyrna, a man in Anatolia is now radicalized. His name is:\n Cemal Madanoğlu."
wrf.38.a:0 "Komm, Süsser Tod."
wrf.39.t:0 "The Tachanka Pact"
wrf.39.d:0 "Taking it's name from the infamous Tachanka deals between the Linguists and Enver, the Atsiz government have now sent a delegation to Trabzon to merge the two Nationalist forces in Anatolia. Now with the kemalists defeated, Anatolia can be unified."
wrf.39.a:0 "And then the black horse marched.."
wrf.39.b:0 "No! No way we are supporting them!"
wrf.40.t:0 "Turanists Siege Istanbul!"
wrf.40.d:0 "The Turanists in Constantinople has succeded in their efforts to destroy the local mandate, and now have absorbed themselves to our order in Bursa. Western Turkey is now under the Wolf's Command."
wrf.40.a:0 "POWER!"
wrf.41.t:0 "Warriors of Judea and Quraysh"
wrf.41.d:0 "With most of Anatolia being under us, the esoteric ulema in Konya are now defensless against our attacks. We can, homever, delay the bloodshed and conscript new men by creating Islamic myths about how they are the warriors of Judea, Prophet Musa (Moses) and the heirs of Quraysh, Muhammed's tribe. They are desperate for protection and peace, so they will accept this ridiclous offer."
wrf.41.a:0 "Reactionaries at our boots."
wrf.42.t:0 "Moving into Ankara"
wrf.42.d:0 "Ankara is a city with the peasents supporting the Kemalist revolution, so Orbay has occupied the city during the collapse of the mandate to avoid the communists to take power in the agrarian region. We have now ordered Orbay to give command of his armies and resources to us and him to join our ranks that he will accept."
