 ant.5.t:0 "Operation Engels"
 ant.5.d:0 "Fuller lowered his binoculars, and got up from the makeshift chair he was sitting.\n "What do we do now, sir?" asked a Black Guard enforcer. Fuller grunted and replied with his gas mask amplified voice: \n "You and your brigade is going to shell the mines, and my army is going to blitz through the city and burn their supplies." \n The guard nodded in confusion, not understanding how Fuller could be this cold and apathetic in a situation like this. He asked the notorious general: "Sir, what are we going to do about the women and the children? Our scouts report that the families of the militants live in the mines or the city itself. Should I dispatch a team to recover th-"\n Fuller pulls the safety of his gun, blocking the enforcer's voice. Fuller grunts: \n "They provide warmth and food to the militans. I will not elaborate further.""

 ant.35.d:0 ""Here you see, Ali. These tall blonde men with blue helmets are your enemies. They have been raping your country just for greed and profit. You and your militants will go on a Jihad against them. Do it for Allah, and your late mother and your precious brothers that these Munafıq horde have taken from you. Allahu Akbar!" said Fuller to the native militant in perfect Turkish.\n "I understand Sir Fuller, we have heard your name in bad situations but I can see that you are not a bad person, but instead a hero to opressed peoples like ours. We will commence the attack now."\nThe militant gathered his men and started an attack on the motherbase using weapons from Fuller's arsenal.\n "What are we going to do with them when they conquer the Motherbase?" asks an officer of German origin.\n "They will not conquer it. Upon their penetration of the motherbase, we will deploy our artillery barrage and drive a tank into the complex, giving the illusion of fraternity to jihadis meanwhile we will go on the second part of the program, where we drop the Sulfur mustard, known to the world as Mustard Gas thank to your Kaiser."\n The officer stood there for a second. His skin went pale from the horrors he will commit under the rule of this man, but he knew that this was the right thing to do."
 ant.36.t:0 "A Visit To The Capital"
 ant.36.d:0 "Fuller sat down in a dirt cheap coffee shop in Ankara, the walls were peeling and the seating was all outdoors in the street, but the coffee was still decent despite everything. He had to wrap himself as much as possible, his skin was a dead giveaway if anybody saw him. Still, these damn Turks aren't blood well as intelligent as any decent Englishmen, so his disguise only had to be simple. The coffee shop was seated just adjacent to the Mandate headquarters, or at least what they claimed to be headquarters, and provided a good vantage point in looking for patrols and guard shifts and the like. Suddenly he could hear the trampling of feet, their uneven cadence meant it probably wasn't military, but it was getting closer."Hello brother, how is this wonderful day treating you?" A large man slammed himself down in the seat next to puller, his eyes appeared genuine and dull, and his facial features showed him as a Steppe Turk, ancestrally some kind of Mongolian most likely. His belly was large but his arm muscles were larger, probably some kind of butcher or craftsman.Fuller straightened himself and put on the thickest Kurdish accent he could, "Hello my brother, it appears I am merely drinking coffee and watching the crowds."The large man laughed and slammed his hand onto the table, unfortunately it appears that the usually Kurd trick would not work on him."Ahhhh a Kürt, we don't see too many of your kind around here, at least not in the garrison."The garrison? Puller shot his head over to the man sitting next to him, and under his robes there was certainly a British uniform of some kind.Fuller pulled his accent back slightly and began to talk to the man genuinely, as per his race and idiocy he gave quite a good amount of information on the workings of the Garrison for the Capital, but as Fuller finished their chat and pushed himself back into the crowds, he only thought one thing..."
