AUT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great War hit Austria hard, inflicting not only a loss of empire, but also a general collapse in Central Europe. As such, the politicial situation is in turmoil, as groups with entirely different ideals attempt to take power. The so called \"Austrofascists\" have seen a huge increase in popularity, due to their effective tactics of capitalising on people's nostalgia for the old Empire. Will Austria restore the Empire, or will it take a more lenient approach and reconcile with its former subjects?"

### Decisions ###

AUT_state_of_emergency_decisions_desc:0 "The once unthinkable has now happened, and Engelbert Dollfuss, the man who built our nation from the ground, is dead. This sudden tragedy has thrown the country imto chaos, and the ugly beast of socialism is rearing its head once more. If we are to overcome it and save the nation, urgent action is needed.\n \n§RExlcusively using the police to resore order will strenghten Schussnigg's hand in the power struggle."
AUT_secure_vienna:0 "Secure Vienna"
AUT_secure_vienna_desc:0 "Nowhere is the chaos greater than in the capital, Vienna. Since Dollfuss died there has been constant rioting, which now threatens to escalate into revolution. Only a clear show of force can pacify this discontent before it goes too far."
AUT_heimwehr_secure_lower_austria:0 "Use the Heimwehr to restore order in Lower Austria"
AUT_heimwehr_secure_lower_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Lower Austria, we shall use Starhemberg's own Heimwehr units, ensuring that loyalty is maintained, even if they lack the efficiency of trained police."
AUT_police_secure_lower_austria:0 "Use the Police to restore order in Lower Austria"
AUT_police_secure_lower_austria_desc:0 "To restore order in Lower Austria, we shall use the police. This is the most efficient means to bring back stability, but the police is controlled by Schussnigg, so we should be wary of becoming too dependent on them."

AUT_lift_state_of_emergency_desc:0 "With order having returned, we may now lift the State of Emergency that Starhemberg earlier proclaimed, restoring many rights to the people and signalling clearly that we believe the crisis has passed."

### Focuses ###

AUT_merge_the_posts:0 "Merge the Posts"
AUT_merge_the_posts_desc:0 "To fully solidify Dollfuss' hold on power, it is now being proposed that we merge Miklas' post of Bundesprasident -the official head of state- with Dollfuss own post as Bundeskanzler. This would clearly make him the sole, unchallenged power in Austria, but we will need to tread carefully to succeed."
AUT_economic_reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
AUT_economic_reforms_desc:0 "Despite all of our previous efforts at turning around the Austrian economy, it remains stagnant at best. In the long term this could greatly undermine the credibility of our government and policies, so we must act quickly to reinvigorate the economic situation."
AUT_maintain_agrarianism:0 "Maintain Agrarianism"
AUT_maintain_agrarianism_desc:0 "A man of peasant roots himself, Dollfuss has, since the start of his career, been an agrarian through and through. He has always championed the interests of the Austrian peasantry, for they alone represent the true spirit of the Catholic German people. Although we need to re-energize our policies, the principles which ground them will remain the same."
AUT_new_industrialism:0 "New Industrialism"
AUT_new_industrialism_desc:0 "Although we have always been an agrarian party, the party of the common farmer, we can no longer pretend that these policies are enough. If Austria’s economy is stagnant, it is because she is completely bereft of the industry needed to compete with other nations. Only a new industrialization drive will allow us to confront the issues which we face."
AUT_corporatist_ideals:0 "Corporatist Ideals"
AUT_corporatist_ideals_desc:0 "Inspired by the Quadregismo Anno and by our opposition to both socialism and liberal capitalism, corporatist ideology has always guided our economic policy. We should now look to strengthen the Corporate State in Austria, and  legally enshrine our ideals."
AUT_further_state_intervention:0 "Further State Intervention"
AUT_further_state_intervention_desc:0 "The failings of liberal nations to deal with the effects of the Depression, -failures which previous Austrian governments also repeated- make clear that only determined and precise state intervention can turn an economy around. Through increasing our spending and our investments, we should pull Austria out of the crisis in no time!"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer:0 "Protect the Common Farmer"
AUT_protect_the_common_farmer_desc:0 "How can the honest, hardworking small farmers of this nation hope to survive in a global market, faced with unlimited competition from vast foreign businesses? If we are truly to represent the farmers of Austria, we must enact new tariffs to ensure a market for their hard-earned produce."
AUT_grain_exports:0 "Grain Exports"
AUT_grain_exports_desc:0 "Having now strengthened the hand of our own agricultural sector and greatly increased our own production through the tariffs, we can now look to exporting much larger amounts of our newly plentiful grain. It's no secret that in many a nation agriculture has not recovered as it has here, and the abundance of buyers and potential trade deals will surely go some way to reinvigorating the economy."
AUT_aristocratic_ties:0 "Aristocratic Ties"
AUT_aristocratic_ties_desc:0 "As well as the peasantry, we have another key support base in Austria’s ancient aristocracy. Represented in our government by such figures as Prince Starhemberg, they have a great deal of influence and we would be failing ourselves if we couldn't keep them happy with our policies. As such we should meet with and reach out to key aristocrats, and seek to accommodate their demands."
AUT_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
AUT_land_reform_desc:0 "Having now secured the loyalty of the gentry, we should in return expect them to collaborate with us in finally implementing our long promised land reform projects, distributing significant amounts of land to both the State and smaller farmers. With the co-operation of all, Austrian agriculture will flourish like never before!"
AUT_nation_of_farmers:0 "A Nation of Farmers"
AUT_nation_of_farmers_desc:0 "With our agrarian reforms firmly in place and the loyalty of the rural population, rich and poor alike, secured, we can truly call oursleves a nation of farmers. Agriculutree is what has lifted our economy out of stagnation, and agriculture is what shall ensure future growth. And within the honorable peasantry of this nation, the true spirit of the Catholic German is seen."
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen:0 "Farmers to Factoryworkers"
AUT_farmers_to_factorymen_desc:0 "As we industrialize we will need men to work in the new factories and we can only hope to do this by promoting migration from the countryside to expand rural areas. As agriculture loses its sway on the economy, farmers will be forced to move to the cities anyway, so we might as well encourage them to do so now."
AUT_new_export_markets:0 "New Export Markets"
AUT_new_export_markets_desc:0 "With our industrial capacity rapidly increasing, Austrian businesses are now branching out into a number of new goods, and should soon be able to compete with foreign companies. Subsidizing these efforts and negotiating trade deals on their bhealf should reinvigorate our economy, and help pull us out of the erstwhile slump."
AUT_ties_with_business:0 "Ties With Business"
AUT_ties_with_business_desc:0 "As we industrialize we will need the support of the businessmen of this country, on whom we must depend to lead the economy forwards. By meeting with prominent business representatives and giving them more sway in the government, we can sure that their needs are accommodated and their loyalty is secured."
AUT_new_labour_charter:0 "New Labour Charter"
AUT_new_labour_charter_desc:0 "Having now secured the allegiance of business, we should expect them to fulfill their end of the bargain, integrating their companies into the larger state corporations and agreeing to a new Charter on Workers' Rights, to be signed in accordance with the leaders of our state-controlled Trade Unions. The principle of corporatism in Austria will be strengthened like never before."
AUT_nation_of_industry:0 "A Nation of Industry"
AUT_nation_of_industry_desc:0 "With our industrial reforms now in place, and new factories springing up around the country, we can finally proclaim that Austria is now a truly industrial nation. Our vastly enhanced production, within the auspices of the Corporate State, will lead to previously impossible levels of prosperity for all Austrians."
AUT_austrian_miracle:0 "The Austrian Miracle"
AUT_austrian_miracle_desc:0 "We have done it. With our economic reforms firmly implemented and the country pulled clean out of the depression, an economic boom has set in. As foreign investment soars and the standard of living skyrockets, the press proclaims this the "Austrian Miracle". And what else is it, for it is our faith in God and dedication to Him that has brought us this far."
AUT_deepen_church_ties:0 "Deepen Church Ties"
AUT_deepen_church_ties_desc:0 "Now that we have further consolidated power, we should look to further strengthening our bonds with the only guarantor of a righteous and just government, and of a moral population - the Catholic Church. Through further meeting with the clergy, especially Cardinal Innitzer, and strengthening the role of Catholic teachings in our law, we can solidify the Church's position in Austria and further gain their approval."
AUT_revise_the_concordat:0 "Revise the Concordat"
AUT_revise_the_concordat_desc:0 "Having signed a Concordat with the Papacy in 1934, it may now be time to review the agreement. If we can secure increased Church backing for education and social programs in Austria, our own position will be greatly strengthened and the people will be benefited enormously. Meanwhile, the tacit support of the Catholic Church will further legitimize our regime."
AUT_clergy_in_the_government:0 "Clergy in the Government"
AUT_clergy_in_the_government_desc:0 "Having resolved to draw closer to the Church, we would now be well advised to reach out to the Priests of Austria, involving them more in local government, and consulting prominent clergymen on legislation. With the advice and support of men of God, Austria will be greater than ever."
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching:0 "Promote Catholic Social Teaching"
AUT_promote_catholic_social_teaching_desc:0 "If we are to   truly repay the trust and support of the Church, we must seek to make Austrian society truly reflect its teaching. Through reforms to education, new family programs, and public information campaigns, we can begin to spread the Church's social teaching around the nation."
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements:0 "Unite the Youth Movements"
AUT_unite_the_youth_movements_desc:0 "There are already several Catholic and nationalist youth groups in Austria, such as the Heimwehr's Young Fatherland, the Ostmarkjugend, and the Christian-German Gymnastics Youth. Although these are already tied to our regime, Guido Zernatto now intends to unite them into one group, the Osterreichisches Jungvolk. This new movement will teach the youth true Catholic values, and prepare them to defend Austria."
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith:0 "Extol Dollfuss’s Faith"
AUT_extol_dollfuss_faith_desc:0 "Before first accepting the post of Chancellor, Dollfuss prayed all night in his favorite church. His piety has long been well known, and has always earned him the respect of the public and of the Church. It is now time to take advantage of this, encouraging the populace to follow his admirable example and emulate his devotion to God."
AUT_catholic_education:0 "Catholic Education"
AUT_catholic_education_desc:0 "Having agreed on education provisions in the revised Concordat, we should now expand on this further, greatly increasing our overall funding for education while also bringing the teachings of the Church further into the curriculum. With a faithful and educated youth, Austria will truly prosper!"
AUT_a_moral_people:0 "A Moral People"
AUT_a_moral_people_desc:0 "With our pro-Catholic policies having now been in place for some time, Austrian society is changing to reflect our ideals, with a greater emphasis on Christianity and morality developing among much of the population, and the Catholic aspects of Austria’s culture becoming more prominent. We should use this to our advantage, and encourage the people to go even further for s moral Austria."
AUT_austrian_identity:0 "The Austrian Identity"
AUT_austrian_identity_desc:0 "It is absolutely vital for the survival of Austria and of our faith that we stamp out what remains of pan-Germanism, greatly emphasizing sll that sets us apart from our neighbors to the North. By evoking a new pride in Austria’s own, unique culture and history we can give rise to a new patriotism, and strengthen our own government."
AUT_catholic_nationalism:0 "Catholic Nationalism"
AUT_catholic_nationalism_desc:0 "Now that we have worked towards evoking a new national pride among the people, it is important that we place great emphasis on the Catholic elements of Austrian patriotism. To defend Austria is to defend its faith and its God: let none forget this truth."
AUT_lead_by_example:0 "Lead By Example"
AUT_lead_by_example_desc:0 "Now, more than ever, it is crucial that Dollfuss proves himself to be the most righteous leader Austria could hope for. Through further showing his own credentials as a devout Catholic and a brave patriot with a distinguished record in the great war, Dollfuss can aptly remind the people that to commit to Austria is to commit to his government."
AUT_a_moral_government:0 "A Moral Government"
AUT_a_moral_government_desc:0 "Having gone so far to promote patriotism and morality among the public, we should ensure that we ourselves aren't falling short of the standards we've set. Through routing out the inevitable corruption, treason, and decadence within the state we can truly prove ourselves to the people as a fair and principled government."
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit:0 "Mit Dollfuss in die Neue Zeit"
AUT_mit_dollfuss_in_die_neue_zeit_desc:0 "A new age is dawning over Austria. As the Church bells peel and the Heimwehr marches through the street, as the drums of the OJV beat and  the anthem sounds far and wide, it is clear to all that Dollfuss has won. Austria has been rebuilt in his vision and to his specifications, and nothing is left to stop him. All as it should be."
AUT_react_to_the_crisis:0 "React to the Crisis"
AUT_react_to_the_crisis_desc:0 "With Dollfuss dead, Starhemberg has already moved to proclaim a State of Emergency against the nation. It is inevitable that socialist resistance will flair up, and we must tread very carefully to ensure that it's nipped in the bud. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, there will surely be a great deal of political maneuvering within the VF, with Kurt Schussnigg seeking to extend his power."
AUT_schussnigg_at_the_helm:0 "Schussnigg at the Helm"
AUT_schussnigg_at_the_helm_desc:0 "With Starhemberg's resignation, Kurt Schussnigg has been able to merge the posts of Bundeskanzler and Bundesprasident under himself, as Dollfuss had first planned to do. He will now be able to pursue his vision of a united, technocratic Austria, and we must all work with him for the glory of the nation."
AUT_emergency_investments:0 "Emergency Investments"
AUT_emergency_investments_desc:0 "The Austrian economy has been struggling for years now, and the recent crisis hardly helped. Only a new program of government spending and investment can stimulate it again and bring about a return to prosperity. As such, Chancellor Schussnigg has organized widespread emergency investments in order to pull Austria's economy firmly out of stagnation."
AUT_support_the_beureaucrats:0 "Support the Bureaucrats"
AUT_support_the_beureaucrats_desc:0 "Schussnigg's staunchest supporters over the last months have been the bureaucrats and administrators of the nation, attracted by his vision and promises of a meritocratic and technocratic Austrian state. We need now to repay their loyalty, and to begin building Schussnigg's ideal state. As such, we should begin reshuffling the bureaucracy to ensure that loyal and capable administrators are favored."
AUT_suppress_the_heimwehr:0 "Suppress the Heimwehr"
AUT_suppress_the_heimwehr_desc:0 "Although Starhemberg has been forced to resign the role of Chancellor, he still holds an unsettling amount of influence through his position as leader of the Heimwehr paramilitary. To challenge this potentially dangerous organisation, we should move to demote its allies from influential posts, chip away at its official powers and privileges, and subtly discourage membership of it."
AUT_technocratic_economy:0 "Technocratic Economy"
AUT_technocratic_economy_desc:0 "With a strengthened bureaucracy now tightening its hold of Austria under Chancellor Schussnigg, it is time to reform our corporatist economic policies to better reflect this emerging reality. By giving bureaucratic boards control of the nation's corporations and ensuring that the emerging technocracy structures the economy well, we will surely be able to pull ourselves out of the depression."
AUT_technocratic_government:0 "Technocratic Government"
AUT_technocratic_government_desc:0 "With Schussnigg increasingly empowering his supporters in the bureaucracy and striving to reform the Standestaat to meet his own vision, a new technocracy is finally emerging, with Schussnigg firmly at the centre of this change. Long live the Standestaat and long live its gallant administrators!"
AUT_guided_industrialisation:0 "Guided Industrialization"
AUT_guided_industrialisation_desc:0 "We must recognize that, without a major industrial capacity, the Austrian economy is doomed to perpetual stagnation. Although the agrarianism of the Dollfuss years was widely supported, the time has come to move on from such quaint ideals. Co-ordinated by the empowered bureaucracy, new industrial centers across Austria will have to be opened, alongside broader investment in industrialization."
AUT_cult_of_efficiency:0 "Cult of Efficiency"
AUT_cult_of_efficiency_desc:0 "With the economy now well on its way to recovery, it is time to further stimulate our growth by promoting a devotion to efficient production among the industrialists and bosses within the Corporate State, encouraging competition to reach new levels of production efficiency, and greater funds and contracts in exchange. The goods will roll off the production lines like never before!"
AUT_meritocratic_state:0 "Meritocratic State"
AUT_meritocratic_state_desc:0 "If our technocracy is to survive, it must be a meritocratic one. Only the most competent beuraeaucrats and administrators will be able to guide the country forward and implement Schussnigg's vision. As such, we must constantly seek the most talented men in the administration, and favor them for promotions and opportunities regardless of their background or standing. A Christian State must be a fair state."
AUT_extent_of_reforms:0 "The Extent of Our Reforms"
AUT_extent_of_reforms_desc:0 "In recent months, Figl and his Young Guard allies have only risen in prominence, accumulating more and more influence and publicity. Meanwhile, the more conservative and authoritarian members of the government are more and more concerned about the growing reformist influence. Tensions are clearly coming to a head, and the coming weeks may settle the fate of our nation..."
AUT_establish_frontmilitz:0 "Establish the Frontmilitz"
AUT_establish_frontmilitz_desc:0 "For some time we have been repressing the Heimwehr, forcing much of its leadership out of key positions and discouraging membership. However, this has meant that the immense potential of a state paramilitary has gone to waste. As such, we should formally abolish the Heimwehr, merging it and other nominally loyal paramilitaries into a united "Frontmilitz" organization, under a loyal leadership."
AUT_revive_nationalism:0 "Revive Austrian Nationalism"
AUT_revive_nationalism_desc:0 "The recent bouts of instability and financial trouble have all gone some way to undermine the people's sense of pride in this nation. Lest the ugly specter of Pan-Germanism return, we should seek to use the extensive resources propaganda and coercion resources at our disposal to reawaken sense of national pride and belonging among Austria's people. Heil Osterreich!"
AUT_beureaucratic_boom:0 "The Bureaucrats' Boom"
AUT_beureaucratic_boom_desc:0 "With the economy having by now been pulled out of the crisis, the future looks bright for Austria. Under the responsible of our extensive bureaucracy, the economy is reaching new heights and the goods are rolling off the lines. A boom is right around the corner, and with market confidence surging, it may be even sooner than we think!"
AUT_the_defense_of_austria:0 "The Defense of Austria"
AUT_the_defense_of_austria_desc:0 "Regardless of how times have improved for the nation, we cannot ignore the constant dangers that surround us in the world. The world stage is only getting more and more tense, and it seems inevitable that we shall have to fight for our freedom and faith. As such, we must further invest in the Frontmilitz and military, and see better to our defenses. Thus, Austria will always stand tall in the world."
AUT_christlich_deutsch_gerecht_und_frei:0 "Christlich, Deutsch, Gerecht, und Frei"
AUT_christlich_deutsch_gerecht_und_frei_desc:0 "We have done it. Although many concessions and compromises have had to be made along the way, Schussnigg's vision of a fair and technocratic corporate state has been finally realized. The climb up the mountain has been a tough one, but at last we can enjoy the beautiful view from the summit."
AUT_starhemberg_unbroken:0 "Starhemberg Unbroken"
AUT_starhemberg_unbroken_desc:0 "Although the challenges were many, and the road was a long and tough one, Ernst Rudiger Starhemberg finally stands triumphant. Unbeaten by communists and reformists alike, the Prince finally stands able to empower the gallant men of the Heimwehr to save Austria, and to ready the nation for the inevitable wars of tomorrow. Dollfuss, no doubt, is already smiling down upon us from Heaven."
AUT_remove_the_moderates:0 "Remove the Moderates"
AUT_remove_the_moderates_desc:0 "Although Schussnigg has been forced to abandon his ambitions to lead the country, he remains as Interior Minister, and his bureaucratic backers still hold a great deal of influence throughout the country. If we are to secure our grip on power, it is vital that we remove these potential threats from their positions of influence - and do something about Schussnigg himself."
AUT_form_a_heimwehr_cabinet:0 "Form a Heimwehr Cabinet"
AUT_form_a_heimwehr_cabinet_desc:0 "Ever since its origins in the successful defense of Carinthia and Styria from Slavic invaders, the Heimwehr has dreamed of independently forming a government. And finally, with Starhemberg at the helm of the nation, that dream can be realized. By stacking the cabinet with good Heimwehr men, we can ensure a loyal administration of competent and valiant patriots."
AUT_solutions_to_the_slump:0 "Solutions to the Slump"
AUT_solutions_to_the_slump_desc:0 "The Austrian economy has been in the gutter for years now, something that was regrettably hardly helped by Dollfuss’s failure to fully implement the Corporate State before his death. Now, it is down to us to begin revitalizing the economy and building a true corporatist system in Austria. As such, we should begin to further invest in work programs and expand the State corporations, to pull Austria out of the slump."
AUT_rejuvenate_corpoatism:0 "Rejuvenate Corporatism"
AUT_rejuvenate_corpoatism_desc:0 "We have to recognize that the Corporate State in Austria has, so far, been anything but complete. Hindered by compromise with financial interests and suffocated of investment, corporatism is struggling to truly take shape. However, with the visionaries of the Heimwehr now in control of the VF, this can now change. With new willpower and investments, the dream of the Corporate State can finally come true."

AUT_austrian_militarism_desc:0 "As the global situation becomes more and more tense, and war seems inevitable to return to Europe, we must prepare to have to defend our homeland and our freedom once again.

AUT_back_in_black:0 "Austrian Miracle"
AUT_back_in_black_desc:0 "Finally, our reforms and investments are visibly paying off. Unemployment has been extensively reduced, and every measure of our economic strength is only increasing. It is clear that the implementation of a true corporate state has absolutely succeeded in saving the nation from poverty and want, and some are now even predicting a boom around the corner."
AUT_militarise_the_corporate_state:0 "Militarise the Corporate State"
AUT_militarise_the_corporate_state_desc:0 "Now that the economy is firmly on its feet, and the corporate state is well in place, it is essential that we take advantage of our new wealth to strengthen our military capacity. By further investing in the military production of the Corporations, and funding the construction of additional military industry, we will soon be able to show the world that we are ready for anything they throw at us."
AUT_profits_of_militarism:0 "The Profits of Militarism"
AUT_profits_of_militarism_desc:0 "It would appear that our injection of militarism into society and into the Corporate State has worked even better than we could have hoped. With the Corporations pumping out arms like never before, and every boss and worker knowing that his patriotic duty is to produce as much as he can, the economy is soaring, and with it the common man's standard of living. Hurrah for Stahrhemberg and the Corporate State!"
AUT_ties_to_the_aristocracy:0 "Ties to the Aristocracy"
AUT_ties_to_the_aristocracy_desc:0 "The VF regime has always had a close relationship with Austria's aristocracy, one which we now have a valuable opportunity to strengthen. Starhemberg, himself the scion of an ancient family of aristocratic commanders, will meet with a number of representatives from the nobility, in the hope of finding more common ground and securing their support for new investments in the countryside."
AUT_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
AUT_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Although we have made much progress in consolidating our rule, we still have plenty of obstacles to face, with many, especially more junior members of the administration, still harboring reformist sympathies. As we decide what to do with them, it is also vital that we place new checks on the loyalty of bureaucrats, commanders, and administrators, to stamp out sedition wherever possible."
AUT_the_cult_of_starhemberg:0 "The Cult of Starhemberg"
AUT_the_cult_of_starhemberg_desc:0 "Prince Stahrhemberg is, in many ways, the perfect dictator. A deeply striking and charismatic man, and the scion of an ancient aristocratic family, he has extensive potential to be adored by the population. Already, something of a personality quote is starting to take shape among the Heimwehr's more committed supporters, something which we should take advantage of and further encourage."
AUT_heimwehr_heroism:0 "Heimwehr Heroism"
AUT_heimwehr_heroism_desc:0 "Few in this country are more valiant than the men of the Heimwehr. Since the birth of the modern Austrian nation, when their gallant deeds saved Carinthia and Styria from marauding Slavs, they have defended us from foreign warmongers and socialist scum alike. Their daily valor must never be forgotten, indeed the population should learn to celebrate these men as the exemplary heroes they are."
AUT_the_old_austria:0 "The Old Austria"
AUT_the_old_austria_desc:0 "Our promotion of militarism and Austrian nationalism, all exemplified by the figure of Starhemberg himself, the aristocratic commander of the nation.

AUT_fur_freiheit_und_ehre_desc:0 ""Fur freiheit und ehre": so goes the chorus of the Heimwehr's march - and it is upon those two principles that Starhemberg has rebuilt the nation.

And as long as Starhemberg lives, so lives the honor of Austria and its gallant people."

AUT_a_hesitant_approach:0 "A Hesitant Approach"
AUT_a_hesitant_approach_desc:0 "Whatever our ideals, a restoration in the current climate would be disastrous for the nation. Otto is young, and has no experience as a ruler, potentially making him a liability for the regime.

AUT_promise_a_restoration_desc:0 "We have already promised in private to Otto von Habsburg that the monarchy will be restored, and now it is time to promise the same in public to the people of this great nation.

AUT_form_a_republican_cabinet_desc:0 "As we consolidate power in Austria, we will have to assume the trappings of a legitimate and responsible government, officially forming a new provisional cabinet for the Republic.

AUT_crush_the_reactionaries:0 "Crush the Reactionaries"
AUT_crush_the_reactionaries_desc:0 "Although we have largely assumed control of the country, large numbers of Heimwehr are still resisting the revolution, hiding in the woods and mountains and plotting our downfall. Meanwhile, the apparatus of the state and civil service is still riddled with Dollfuss's old running dogs. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue, and only a harsh crackdown can relieve the imminent threat of a counter-revolution."
AUT_dismatle_the_standestaat:0 "Dismantle the Standestaat"
AUT_dismatle_the_standestaat_desc:0 "Although the Standestaat is no more, its laws and constitution are still, formally at least, in place. In the long term, this will undermine us and our status as the legitimate Austrian government. As such, we must formally abolish Dollfuss’s constitution, and set about repealing the tyrannical laws passed under his regime."
AUT_initial_reforms:0 "Initial Reforms"
AUT_initial_reforms_desc:0 "The Austrian economy has long been in the gutter, something hardly helped by the ongoing chaos. Meanwhile, if we are to build a socialist Austria, the need to move on from the failed wreck of corporatism is becoming urgent. As such, it is time for President Renner to authorize new economic measures, ensuring the power of independent trade unions and government aid for the poor and destitute."
AUT_rehabilitate_the_police:0 "Rehabilitate the Police"
AUT_rehabilitate_the_police_desc:0 "As we restore order around the nation, the co-operation and support of Austria's police force will be vital, besides going a long way to legitimize our government. Nonetheless, the police has, over the past 4 years, been used extensively by the now-vanquished tyrants to suppress Austria's workers, and many officers are implicit in Dollfuss's crimes. As such, we must further define our policy towards the police force."
AUT_use_our_paramilitaries:0 "Use our Paramilitaries"
AUT_use_our_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Sadly, order has not been restored sufficiently for us to rely on the 'official' forces of government alone. With the Heimwehr still posing a threat to the government, we must strengthen the hand of the Republikanischer Schutzbund, along with smaller paramilitaries, to combat terrorists and insurrectionaries. Only force today can ensure peace tomorrow."
AUT_fight_the_heimwehr:0 "Fight the Heimwehr"
AUT_fight_the_heimwehr_desc:0 "We can no longer the extreme threat posed to the government, and to democracy itself, by the terrorists of the Heimwehr. Nor can we passively sit by, and wait for them to topple us, making all the sacrifices made over the last months in vain. As such, we must crack down on these reactionary bandits harder than ever before, if democracy in Austria is to have any hope of prevailing."
AUT_secure_our_grip:0 "Secure our Grip"
AUT_secure_our_grip_desc:0 "Although the Heimwehr is now mostly in open retreat, and the population has now essentially accepted the new government, much work remains to be done. As such Renner has authorized the Schutzbund and loyal elements of the police to deal one final blow to the resistance, mopping up the last major pockets of insurrection and rounding up the resistance's leaders. Peace, it seems, is slowly returning to Austria."
AUT_secure_foreign_recognition:0 "Secure Foreign Recognition"
AUT_secure_foreign_recognition_desc:0 "In order to further legitimise our government, it is vital that the international community recognize us as Austria's government.

As such, Renner has resolved to make a major speech one week from now."
AUT_sieze_the_wealth:0 "Seize the Wealth"
AUT_sieze_the_wealth_desc:0 "No longer can the Austrian bourgeoise grow fat off the backs of the common man, continuing to profit and live the high life while ordinary citizens suffer amidst political chaos! As proposed by Alfred Klahr, the Austrian government will now immediately begin redistributing wealth and land away from the rich, regardless of their complaints."
AUT_promise_property_rights:0 "Promise Property Rights"
AUT_promise_property_rights_desc:0 "Whatever our socialist principles, the worst political crisis in years is no time for drastic reforms, which may turn vast sections of the population against us, only strengthning our enemies. As such, Renner, in spite of Alfred Klahr's protests, has resolved to publicly promise that the republican government will respect the private property of its citizens."
AUT_secure_the_workers_loyalty:0 "Secure the Workers' Loyalty"
AUT_secure_the_workers_loyalty_desc:0 "As we consolidate the government, it is essential that we maintain the support of our core base, and the demographic that we strive to represent: the workers of Austria. By further guaranteeing their rights to strike and unionize, so harshly suppressed under the Standestaat, and by encouraging the formation of new unions, we can secure their support for years to come."
AUT_further_investments:0 "Further Investments"
AUT_further_investments_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, Austria's economy remains in dire straits, and the continued instability is hardly helping. Knowing that this can't be allowed to continue, lest the opposition and reactionaries gain one more thing to attack us over, the cabinet has resolved to invest further in pulling Austria out of poverty, whatever it takes."
AUT_draft_a_constitution:0 "Draft a Constitution"
AUT_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "With order having at last been mostly restored, the task now falls to us to create a proper constitution for the reborn republic. Renner, for his part, has every intention of restoring Austria's old republican constitution as it existed before 1932, believing it to be more than sufficient for a democratic state. However, others in the government may come to press for something more... radical."
AUT_rebirth_of_austrian_socialism:0 "The Rebirth of Austrian Socialism"
AUT_rebirth_of_austrian_socialism_desc:0 "Austria has now been under a socialist government for several months, for the first time in some years.

Him being an avid beer connoisseur and especially a lover of the popular brand Stiegl it was clear what has to be done. In collaboration with the Stiegl corporation a new brewery in the heart of Vienna is to be constructed and its beer is to be called 'das Volksbier'. It is similar to the classic Stiegl brew but it comes with a variety of different flavours which will be very popular among the austrian populace and is going to be a key element to austrian beer culture."

AUT_socialist_discotent_desc:0 "Ever since the brief civil war in 1934, the Austrian socialist movement, despite being heavily oppressed and, formally, banned, has, under the leadership of Karl Renner, been a massive source of instability for our regime.

AUT_pan_germanist_discotent:0 "Pan-Germanist Resistance"
AUT_pan_germanist_discotent_desc:0 "Dollfuss’s anti-Pan German, Catholic, and Austrian Nationalist policies have alienated a large proportion of the population, who have always desired an Anschluss, or Union, with our fellow German-speakers to the North and West.

aut.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
aut.1.d:0 "Following a war strewn by hardships and military humiliation, the ancient Hapsburg Empire finally disintegrated in the Autumn of 1918. Initially, the Austrian public overwhelmingly hoped to overcome this monumental defeat through an Anschluss, or unification, with the young German republic. However, the victorious allies staunchly blocked all efforts to make the Pan-German dream a reality, and the later disintegration of Germany in 1919 made these hopes even more far-fetched. However, the young Austrian nation did have some luck, as the Italian civil war and chaos in the Balkans allowed Austrian troops to retake inland Carinthia and parts of Sudtirol. Nonetheless, Austria’s history through the 1920s was one of crippling diplomatic isolation, instability, and political violence, with an endless carousel of Conservative and Socialist governments unable to turn the country around.\n \nThis ended, however, in 1932, when the young economist Engelbert Dollfuss was appointed as Chancellor by President Miklas. Dollfuss wasted no time in implementing his Catholic and nationalist agenda. He hastily took advantage of a constitutional crisis to dissolve the Austrian parliament and crush the main part of the opposition to his government, before introducing a new authoritarian and corporatist constitution. Later surviving a socialist assassination attempt and crushing a leftist putsch by shelling large areas of workers’ housing, Dollfuss has proven that he is determined to stay in power to remodel Austria in his vision.\n \nAll is not well for Austria’s government, however. As socialist and extremist Pan-German nationalist underground movements continue to resist the regime, and with Dollfuss’s corporatist policies so far struggling to turn Austria’s economy around, time will only tell what Austria’s future will be."
aut.1.a:0 "Heil Osterreich!"
aut.2.t:0 "Modifying the Constitution"
aut.2.d:0 "Today President Miklas and Chancellor Dollfuss have officially gained the cabinet's approval for the Constitutional amendment that will merge their two roles. The new post of Bundeskanzler will double as Head of Government and Head of State, and will of course be filled by Dollfuss himself. Dollfuss’s path to total domination now seems clear."
aut.2.a:0 "Excellent"
aut.3.t:0 "The Flag Question"
aut.3.d:0 "With our preparations to revise the Austrian constitution well underway, a new proposal has arisen from some members of the cabinet. They suggest that the party flag of the Vaterlandische Front be elevated to the status of the national flag of Austria, replacing the current eagle flag. While many sympathize with this idea, believing it would do well to symbolize Dollfuss’s new consolidation of power, many others believe that we should maintain continuity, keeping the flag above party politics."
aut.3.a:0 "This is too far"
aut.3.b:0 "It's an effective gesture"
aut.4.t:0 "An Alarming Report"
aut.4.d:0 "Today a most alarming report arrived on Dr. Dollfuss’s desk, from our intelligence agencies monitoring the socialist underground. It states that the rally planned to celebrate the Constitutional Amendment may be in great danger from socialist terrorists, and the life of Dollfuss himself may be at risk. What's more, it states, security provisions are deeply inadequate, making matters even worse. As such some in the cabinet are now calling for the rally to be called off entirely."
aut.4.a:0 "It can't be that bad: go ahead"
aut.4.b:0 "This is too risky: postpone the rally"
aut.5.t:0 "Security Provisions"
aut.5.d:0 "Having chosen to go ahead with the rally, we must now deal with the matter of security. Many in the police and military command are urging us to take extra precautions in light of the recent report, deploying additional troops in Vienna and increasing our expenses to ensure Dollfuss’s safety. Others, however, believe we are being too anxious, and should take a calmer approach."

aut.6.t:0 "Reports of Demoralization"
aut.6.d:0 "Our recent decision to cancel the scheduled rally to mark the revised constitution has clearly had a negative effect on the morale of our troops and of the Heimwehr paramilitaries. Many commanders are reporting their men questioning the dedication of the government, or whether the country truly is as stable as we claim. Why, they are asking, is Dollfuss really feeling the need to hide from his own adoring people? Many are now suggesting that we go ahead with the rally to reverse these worries, but the political U-Turn could be embarrassing. Meanwhile, some are proposing that we make up for the cancellation through having Dollfuss give a major speech over the radio."

aut.8.t:0 "Dollfuss Addresses the Nation by Radio"
aut.8.d:0 "Today, having earlier called off a planned rally due to security concerns, Dr Dollfuss spoke to the people of Austria via radio, having just ratified the amendment to the constitution. After apologizing for failing to speak to them in person, and hoping that they would understand his reasoning in light of recent troubles with the radicals, he promised to use his powers to guide Austria further to economic strength and to shore up its position in central Europe, as well as to do what he could to bring the nation closer to God."
aut.8.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss! Heil Osterreich!"
aut.9.t:0 "The Constitution is Amended"
aut.9.d:0 "Today, in a private ceremony in the Schonbrunn Palace, the Constitution of the Austrian Federal State was formally revised to merge the posts of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under Engerlbert Dollfuss, essentially completing his consolidation of power. However, the fact that a planned rally to mark the event was cancelled, and that nothing was done to substitute for this, has fueled much suspicion among the public, and much undermined our efforts to present ourselves as a confident, stable force in the country. While in time we shall surely recover, Dollfuss’s hand has for now been notably weakened."
aut.9.a:0 "Heil Dollfuss...?"
aut.10.t:0 "Dollfuss Shot!"
aut.10.d:0 "Having just ratified the constitution to merge the roles of Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under himself, Dollfuss proceeded to address a large rally near the Schonbrunn Palace. However, shortly after he started speaking, a heavily armed group of men, presumably socialist militants, burst from the crowd and fired indiscriminately at the platform. Dollfuss was hit three times, and passed away 2 hours later, having received the last rites.\n \nWith the constitutional amendment rendered, for now at least, obsolete, Miklas has appointed Ernst Rudiger Starhemberg as provisional Chancellor. Starhemberg, who was Dollfuss’s right hand man throughout his life, clearly sees himself as the natural successor, and with the support of his large Heimwehr paramilitary, and of much of the army, may well come to fill Dollfuss’s shoes.\n However, Dollfuss’s Minister for the Interior, Kurt Schussnigg, also believes himself capable of succeeding the great chancellor, and has the support of the more moderate wing of the VF, allegedly among them Miklas himself: not to mention that through his ministry he controls the police and he alone can now enforce the impending state of emergency that Starhemberg is preparing to proclaim ./n/Who shall lead the new government?..."

aut.11.d:0 "Today, the changes to the 1933 Concordat that, over the past weeks, had been carefully agreed with the Papacy through Cardinal Innitzer, were formally adopted. Signed in Rome by both Dollfuss and His Holiness, the new revised Concordat ensures Church funding and support for education and social programs in Austria, while also increasing the privileges of the Church snd its autonomy from the Austrian state and right to adjudicate on questions of Church teaching and doctrine.\n This agreement will greatly strengthen our ties with the Church and our popularity among Austrian Catholics, and for that we are grateful."
aut.11.a:0 "Hallelujah!"
aut.12.t:0 "The Jewish Youth Groups"
aut.12.d:0 "Having merged the nationalist and Catholic youth movements into the OJV, we are now faced with an interesting problem: that of the Jewish youth groups, notably the Betar and Hakoah.\n \nMany  in our government, including some Jews sympathetic with Dollfuss, want to see these organizations also merged into the OJV, in order to further integrate Austrian Jews into mainstream society and to ensure that they too are taught the value of patriotism. Others, however, whether out of anti-Semitism or conservative Judaism, would prefer to avoid this integration of Jews into the mainstream of society, while others simply see it as unfair to bring Jewish children into a Catholic youth group. They argue that a separate Jewish Youth Association should instead be set up to accommodate them.\n \nUltimately, the choice is ours."
aut.12.a:0 "Everyone has a place in the OJV"
aut.12.b:0 "Why should Jewish children be raised according to Christian principles?"
aut.13.t:0 "Church Youth Movements"
aut.13.d:0 "Now that we have merged most of the pro-regime and Catholic youth movements into the OJV, we are now confronted with the matter of those groups which are run directly by the Church. So far we have left these groups be as a sign of goodwill to the Church, but there are now calls to integrate them as well into the OJV. The proponents of this argue that since the OJV will teach them the same values, it only makes sense or them to have access to the greater resources of our organization. Of course, it will also expand our own control over the country. Given the recent revision to the Concordat, now is the time to act if we are to do this, while relations with the Church are still high.\n However, many, especially in the Clergy, call for these groups to remain separate from the OJV. They argue that the independence of the Clergy is vital to the spiritual health of the nation, and that since we ourselves have stated this many times it would be deeply hypocritical to go back on our word now.\n Another group has also emerged, which wants us to formally merge these groups into the OJV and give the OJV oversight over them, but to also preserve much of their current autonomy, and to give Church leaders the final say on their activities./n/Whatever our decision is to be, it must be made now."

aut.14.t:0 "Dollfuss’s Height"
aut.14.d:0 "In spite of all his works for the nation, there is one thing that, time and again in his life, has held Engelbert Dollfuss back: his height. Standing at a remarkable 4 foot 11, he had to go to great lengths to be allowed to serve in the great war. His height has drawn attention ever since then, with many foreign commentators especially commenting on his diminutive stature In Austria, meanwhile, jokes about his height are all too popular..\n \nDollfuss himself has never minded any of this, and in fact has a reputation for enjoying - and even, at times, encouraging - jokes about his height. However, as his cult of personality grows and we further secure our power, this may become a thorn in our side. Some in the government, especially those working in propaganda, are now urging us to crack down on humor about Dollfuss’s height and to downplay his reputation. They argue that if Dollfuss can't be respected and taken seriously be the people, our efforts to make them accepts our more controversial policies may well be in vain.\n Dollfuss himself dismisses this idea, and holds onto the belief that only through modesty and a decent sense of humor can he maintain his reputation as a man of the people. But with calls rising for something to be done, it might be time for him to change his mind."

Calling on all Austrians to respect the newly imposed curfews, roadblocks, and searches, and to "resist any subversion by the enemies of our nation".\n \nHowever, some are worrying that his words have already fallen on deaf ears. Across Austria, the ugly beast of socialism has reared its head once more. In every town what's left of the SDAPO and KPO paramilitaries are rioting, and all too many supporters of these groups are turning out to show their support.\n \nVienna itself seems to be at the center of this, with massive socialist demonstrations springing up. The threat to our grip on power is obvious. We must move to secure our position, and we must do it now."

Amidst constant rioting and attacks on the Heimwehr, the police, the army, and any other presumed opponents of their revolution, order has evaporated in the city.\n \nIt seems that the only thing we can do to hold onto power is to disperse the rebels by any means necessary. Loyal Generals and Heimwehr commanders have planned an operation to crush this revolution in one fell swoop, but the unspoken truth is that their proposal is a massacre. What loyal forces remain in Vienna will be urgently reinforced, and will be ordered to fire at will upon the poorly armed and untrained crowds. This alone, it appears, can save the Standestaat."
aut.16.a:0 "We have no choice. Fire at will."

aut.17.t:0 "Vienna Secured"

In every street and every square, hundreds of soldiers and Heimwehr, fully equipped with guns pointed right ahead, stared them down. Their revolution was well and truly over.\n Although a few madmen attempted to fight on - inevitably commiting suicide in the process - the crowds were mostly dispersed calmly, with little bloodshed. Most simply returned to their homes, intimidated but unharmed. The worse elements, those armed or otherwise violent, have been rounded up and will be properly dealt with.\n Although the country is still shaken and far from stable, a semblance of order has returned - and for that we should be grateful."
aut.17.a:0 "Thank God for that!"]
aut.18.t:0 "The Vienna Massacre"
aut.18.d:0 "Our plan has been executed, and the nation is reeling in shock and trauma. This morning, as the protesters and paramilitaries turned out for another day of rebellion, they were fired upon indiscriminately by uncoordinated groups of Heimwehr and soldiers.\n Realizing that time was running out, a large group of Schutzbunders attempted to storm the Chancellery in an abortive putsch. Although Starhemberg considered fleeing, the attempt to seize power as rapidly undone, and his would-be assassins were quickly mowed down by hastily assembled machine guns in the streets below.\n With hundreds wounded or dead, and buildings across the city in ruins, the nation is deeply shaken. No longer can the VF claim the calm, moderate reputation that Dollfuss carefully built, and Starhemberg's own reputation as a murderer will be hard to live down, likely strengthening the hand of Kurt Schussnigg, should he seek power. One thing is sure, however: that Austria will never fall to the Revolution."
aut.18.a:0 "Good God..."
aut.19.t:0 "The Revolution"
aut.19.d:0 "Early this morning, Austria's fate was changed forever. With only small and disorganized bands of Heimwehr putting up resistance, socialist militiamen, dominated by the Schutzbunders of the SDAPO, stormed Vienna. Cheered on by the crowds in the street and met with little resistance, they secured administrative and media buildings across the city one by one. The chancellery fell at 1:34 AM, with three loyalist Heimwehr men falling during its capture. It was later confirmed that Ernst Rudiger Starhemberg has fled with much of his cabinet across the border to Hungary, while Kurt Schussnigg is rumored to have arrived in Berne, having allegedly travelled by train under disguise.\n Leftist militias have by now seized control across the country, engaging in sporadic clashes with the Heimwehr and hurriedly forming new administrations. In Viennna, the veteran Social Democrat and father of the Austrian republic, Karl Renner, has accepted the invitation to form a new provisional government to guide Austria away from Dollfuss’s legacy./n/It is inevitable that this won't be the end of Austria's troubles, of course. Both liberal democrats and communists support the new regime, but it can of course seek to fulfill only one of their visions. Meanwhile, large numbers of Heimwehr are preparing to resist us to the last, and it is certain that Starhemberg will seek to assemble a government in exile.\n \nNobody knows what the future has in store, but for now, at least, everybody is hopeful."

aut.22.t:0 "Schussnigg's Speech"
aut.22.d:0 "The inevitable has happened, and Kurt Schussnigg has, in all but name, launched his bid for leadership of the VF.\n \nSpeaking in Salzburg, he told the gathered crowd, drawn largely from the more moderate wing of the VF, that reform was the only answer to Austria's problems. Without the brilliant leadership of Dollfuss, he stated, only a new technocratic, professional approach could solve the crisis. Denouncing "strongmen and demagogues", an unsubtle attack on Starhemberg, he declared that only through "the prevalence of calm voices and clear heads" could the nation be saved./n/nAlthough Starhemberg's instinct is to remove him from his office and arrest him, Schussnigg controls the police through his role of Interior Minister, and has a great deal of influence across the Party and country, making such a course of action impossible. What's more we can only have a hope of restoring order to the country if the police and Schussnigg's other allies remain loyal - if not to Starhemberg himself, then simply to the Austrian State as it stands and to the principle of unity.\n \nAs such, our only option is to play the long game, and wait for Schussnigg's efforts to fizzle out, while subtly undermining him. Although the struggle for power may take some work, we must win it: for God, for Austria, for us all."
aut.22.a:0 "We'll deal with the bastard, just you see!"
aut.23.t:0 "Meeting the Church?"
aut.23.d:0 "Although it still seems unlikely that Schussnigg will be able to seriously challenge us, his efforts are gradually gathering pace, and it appears that he plans to secure the loyalty of various interest groups within Austria, as a way of undermining our authority and forcing us out. One such group is the Church: if we can reaffirm their implicit support for Starhemberg, we could prove our own legitimacy around the country, but alienating them could well drive them into the arms of Schussnigg. As such, many of Starhemberg's allies are calling on us to arrange a meeting with Cardinal Innitzer, to ensure the Church's loyalty."
aut.23.a:0 "Very well"
aut.23.b:0 "It's not worth it"
aut.24.t:0 "A Meeting with Innitzer"
aut.24.d:0 "Our planned meeting with Cardinal Innitzer has now taken place, and the Cardinal has seized the opportunity to request greater concessions to the Church in Austria, and new efforts on our part to promote Catholic values and teachings. Accepting his demands would ensure the favor and tacit backing of the Church, while turning Innitzer down could well lead Schussnigg from gain his loyalty. However, some argue that the man's demands are simply too many, and that making such concessions could set a dangerous precedent and weaken our own hand. Which course of action do we take?"
aut.24.a:0 "We need to accept"
aut.24.b:0 "Innitzer must be mad to think we'll serve his every whim like this!"
aut.25.t:0 "Schussnigg meets Innitzer"
aut.25.d:0 "Today, our informers have discovered a deeply unsettling truth: that Cardinal Innitzer, presumably feeling alienated by the Starhemberg cabinet and concerned that it would take insufficient care of the Church's status in Austria, has met Kurt Schussnigg. While we'll never really know what was agreed, we can surely expect Schussnigg to greatly use this to legitimise himself among Austrian Catholics, and gain greater support. We have lost the Church's goodwill, and once Schussnigg has been dealt with it will surely take some effort to rebuild our relationship."
aut.25.a:0 "Damn!"
aut.26.t:0 "Schussnigg's Friends"
aut.26.d:0 "From the start of the power struggle, we have been forced to recognize that Schussnigg's influence is simply too great for us to directly dismiss or arrest him. However, if we move with sufficient speed and subtlety, we may be able to strike a major blow at Schussnigg's influence. By rapidly demoting, dismissing, or in extreme cases outright arresting his many supporters within the bureaucracy, we may be able to prevent him from strengthening his existing ties with prominent bureaucrats, and intimidate many others out of supporting him. Others, however, are saying that this simply isn't worth the effort, and an administrative purge would cause a great deal of chaos which would only further hinder our government."
aut.26.a:0 "We have to do it"
aut.26.b:0 "We aren't tyrants"
aut.27.t:0 "Schussnigg Consolidates Alliances"
aut.27.d:0 "Alarming news has reached us: that Kurt Schussnigg has recently been further meeting with prominent administrators and bureaucrats, who are attracted by his technocratic approach and rhetoric. It appears that he has secured his alliance with these figures for good, and any attempt to purge them from here on will be off-limits, as they are now under his umbrella. We can assume from here on that much of the bureaucracy will support Schussnigg, and do what it can to aid him."
aut.27.a:0 "Scheisse!"
aut.28.t:0 "Schussnigg Appeals to the People"
aut.28.d:0 "Schussnigg has now intensified his efforts to gain popular support, making an effort  to appear publicly at every opportunity, and frequently giving speeches outlining his own moderate, technocratic vision for Austria, and subtly attacking Starhemberg as an incompetent and overprivileged strongman. Many within the Cabinet are urging us to do something about this threat to authority, censoring the publicity that Schussnigg receives and depriving him of opportunities to speak. They claim that this could pre-empt much of the damage he's doing, but others are arguing that it simply isn’t worth the effort, and could make us appear overly tyrannical and insecure about our position."
aut.28.a:0 "It's the only way"
aut.28.b:0 "This is too far"
aut.29.t:0 "Meeting the General Staff"
aut.29.d:0 "Although meetings with the military's general staff are a fairly routine thing - especially in a time of crisis - today's proved to be very different. Seemingly siezing on our position of weakness and need for allies in the power struggle, General Jansa, the Chief of Staff, has presented us with a set of demands to increase our funding for the military, increase the Army's autonomy from the civillian government, and, notably, that Starhemberg assure him that the Heimwehr will never challenge or replace the Army's status of the defenders of the nation.\n \nMost in the regime believe we have no choice but to accept, lest we alienate the army and drive it into Schussnigg's hands. Others, however, believe we need to teach Jansa that Starhemberg, not himself, is the leader of Austria, and that he has no right to demand such concessions."
aut.29.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
aut.29.b:0 "Who does Jansa think he is?"
aut.30.t:0 "Schussnigg Meets Jansa"
aut.30.d:0 "One of the most alarming reports yet has reached Starhemberg's desk: that yesterday, in what the two assumed would be total secrecy, Schussnigg and Jansa. It is clear that the general, alienated by our refusal to make concessions to him, and likely fearing that the Heimwehr will outstrip the Army in its prestige and influence, has been driven into Schussnigg's arms. With the support of the Army, Schussnigg will be all but impossible to bring down, and we can only hope that he quietly fades into irrelevance."
aut.30.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
aut.31.t:0 "The Police Dominates the Country"
aut.31.d:0 "In our efforts to restore order, our choice to exclusively use the police has come back to bite us. As the police is controlled by Schussnigg through his role of Interior Minister, he has been able to greatly extend his influence across the country, behind the scenes of restoring stability. This has greatly strengthened his position in the power struggle, and his influence in the government seems to be only increasing."
aut.31.a:0 "Blast!"
aut.32.t:0 "Schussnigg Loses Momentum"
aut.32.d:0 "At long last, we can breathe a sigh of relief. Having struggled to gain new backers or other sources of power, Kurt Schussnigg's efforts to assume leadership of the VF and the country have ran out of momentum, and are rapidly fading into irrelevance. It is clear that Stahrhemberg has triumphed in the power struggle, as we always knew he would.\n \nAs such, there is now no reason not to finally press through with the revision to the constitution, merging the posts of both Bundesprasident and Bundeskanzler under Prince Starhemberg himself. We could not have hoped for a better successor to Dr. Dollfuss, and this great man can finally assume the powers needed to lead our great homeland to glory, honoring Dollfuss's legacy and fulfilling his vision."
aut.32.a:0 "Hurrah!"
aut.33.t:0 "Starhemberg Resigns"
aut.33.d:0 "It is now clear that Kurt Schussnigg's efforts to take over the VF and the nation have only intensified, and only gathered strength. Prince Starhemberg can no longer hide from this harsh reality, and today offered his resignation to President Miklas, astonishing the nation. In his place, Miklas has already appointed Schussnigg.\n \nWith nothing now standing in his way, Schussnigg can now go ahead with Dollfuss’s earlier revision to the constitution, and merge the posts of Bundeskanzler and Bundesprasident under himself, allowing him to fully pursue his vision for Austria. At long last, the nation is in determines, responsible hands, and for that we should rejoice."
aut.33.a:0 "Hurrah!"
aut.34.t:0 "The Rise of Figl"
aut.34.d:0 "The aftermath of the ascent of Schussnigg and his beuraeaucratic supportersw has seen one interesting development: the parralell rise through the ranks of Austria's beuraeaucracy of the young Leopold Figl. An agrarian at heart, he was one of Dollfuss’s proteges since before the Standestaat was born, and has served for some years on the Federal Economic Council. A staunch supporter of Schussnigg, our rise to power has benefited him enormously, and his career seems destined for new heights.\n \nHowever, the strongly reformist instincts that motivated him to back Schussnigg may pose a threat to us in the long run. It is clear that Figl still harbors some sympathy for the democratic system, and sees Schussnigg's more limited reforms as an opportunity to pursue his own much more democratic agenda. He has clearly gathered around him a clique of like-minded young reformists within the bureaucracy, which is being dubbed the "young guard".\n \nAlthough Figl and his allies still lack the political capital to make any major moves, we need to decide on our stance towards them."
aut.34.a:0 "Support their efforts - Figl could be a valuable ally"
aut.34.b:0 "Stay ambivalent for now"
aut.34.c:0 "Their reformism goes too far - we should suppress them while there's still time"
aut.35.t:0 "The Young Guard Wants Concessions"
aut.35.d:0 "Having been hitherto supported by Schussnigg, Figl and his clique have been able to greatly increase their influence and support. Now, they are subtly making clear to us, through an occasional word here and the tacit implications of a speech there, that they are becoming dissatisfied with the pace and reach of our reforms. It is clear that, without further democratization of the Standestaat, it will be impossible to placate Figl and his allies. This would mean sacrificing a great many of Schussnigg's own ideals of a more authoritarian technocracy, and indeed could be seen as a betrayal of what Dollfuss strove to build. Many, however, believe that it is both the right course of action for us, and is point the only course of action we can practically take."
aut.35.a:0 "Very well, Figl can have his reforms"
aut.35.b:0 "This is too far"
aut.36.t:0 "Concerns Among the Conservatives"
aut.36.d:0 "Our recent concessions to the Young Guard have gone some way to alarm the more hardline and conservative elements of Schussnigg's government. In a meeting today with the hardliner Emil Fey, an arch-conservative who found his way into Schussnigg's circle more out of his hatred for Starhemberg than anything else, Schussnigg was warned that Figl is a major threat to the integrity of the Standestaat. Fey proceeded to state that proceeding with his reforms will only serve to embitter large swathes of the population, and appear to be a shameless betrayal of the legacy of Dollfuss. While we knew such a reaction was coming when we agreed to Figl, we must now decide what to do."
aut.36.a:0 "Fey is right: we should put the Young Guard in its place"
aut.36.b:0 "One bitter reactionary doesn't matter"
aut.37.t:0 "A Meeting with Figl"
aut.37.d:0 "It appears that not even the massive concessions we agreed to make to Figl are the full extent of what he wants from us: or indeed, what he will take from us. Today, Figl met with Schussnigg, and, far beyond what Schussnigg expected to be a simple conclusion of what has already been agreed, proceeded to demand a far more extensive democratization of Austria - and, in practice, a new consolidation of the Young Guard's power, with conservatives like Fey quietly sidelined. It would appear that we no longer have the power to turn Figl down: our continuous backing up to now has allowed his allies to gain the support of swathes of the Army and bureaucracy, and his influence is simply too extensive for us to move against him. All we can do now is agree, and resign ourselves to becoming puppets of these scheming liberalizers."
aut.37.a:0 "So be it..."
aut.38.t:0 "The Young Guard Frustrated"
aut.38.d:0 "Our failure to further reform the state to meet their demands has left Figl and the Young Guard deeply frustrated with us, perceiving us as incompetent dictators who will only perpetuate political inertia through our failure to adapt. Many now believe we should agree to further concessions for them, lest we alienate them too much and lose many competent administrators in the process. Others, however, argue that we should simply try to negotiate a compromise with them, in which they will maintain their positions and influence in exchange for giving up on their more liberal ideals."
aut.38.a:0 "Fine, let them have their reforms"
aut.38.b:0 "Find a compromise instead"
aut.39.t:0 "The Young Guard Grows in Influence"
aut.39.d:0 "It is becoming clear that, in recent weeks, Figl and the clique around him have managed to significantly increase their power within the administration, gaining much publicity in the process. In the process, they are greatly antagonising the more conservative members of the regime, notably Emil Fey, an old Heimwehr man who was propelled into Schussnigg's circle almost exclusively because of his contempt for Starhemberg.\n \nSo far, we have tried to ignore the growth of Figl's clique, but it is clear by now that we can do so no longer, and much reach a decision on what to do with them. Many believe that we should recognize their growing influence and draw closer to them, while the conservatives within the government are urging us to reign them in, one way or another."
aut.39.a:0 "We should encourage their efforts"
aut.39.b:0 "Let's reign them in before they get too confident"
aut.40.t:0 "Reigning in the Young Guard"
aut.40.d:0 "Although we have resolved to reign in the influence of Figl and his reformist clique, different approaches as to how we should do this are now being debated. Many believe we should simply start quietly demoting them, and further ignore their suggested reforms. Others, however, especially Emil Fey and his allies, are urging us to go a step further and purge them outright. Although many think this is a step too far and simply unnecessary, others believe that it will put a definite end to the question of how far our reforms will go."
aut.40.a:0 "Just ease them out of power"
aut.40.b:0 "Fey has a point - purge them"
aut.41.t:0 "The Young Guard Resists Demotions"
aut.41.d:0 "Our recent moves to demote the members of Figl's clique and move them away from influential positions has proved to be harder than expected, with many determinedly resisting their demotions, and some even outright refusing to pack up and leave their offices. Before the situation escalates further, or, even worse, becomes public, we need to work out our next move. Many think we should offer them an olive branch, allowing them to hold on to their jobs provided they toe the line and give up on further democratization, while Fey is again arguing that they simply can't be trusted, and that we must purge them before it's too late."
aut.41.a:0 "We need to compromise"
aut.41.b:0 "Fey's been proven right: purge them"
aut.42.t:0 "Figl Goes on the Run"
aut.42.d:0 "Our efforts to purge the Young Guard have clearly met with much less success than we might have hoped, and have today ended in disaster. In a dramatic series of events, Leopold Figl fled the group of policemen who had been sent to detain him, causing a chase through Vienna: a chase which, we have been informed, our men lost. Figl's wherebaouts are now unknown, and it is likely he will be plotting against us and seeking to use what political capital he has left to bring us down.\n \nThere is only one way that we can hope to stop this, and that is by calling in any possible aid from Emil Fey and his clique of hardliners. Having served for some time as Dollfuss’s Vice Chancellor, and an old Heimwehr man, Fey will doubtless know a great deal about Figl's likely next move, and may be able to use his security resources and knowledge to help us track him down. It is, however, inevitable that such aid will come at a dear price, and we may well be expected to make a great many concessions in order to keep Fey happy. Nonetheless, we have no choice."
aut.42.a:0 "So be it: arrange a meeting with Fey"
aut.43.t:0 "A Meeting With Fey"
aut.43.d:0 "Today, Kurt Schussnigg sat down for a special meeting with Emil Fey, a man whose career truly has been ascendent in recent months. It was agreed between the two men that Fey would put all the resources and contacts at his disposal towards the capture of Figl and eradication of the traitors and criminals in the Young Guard, and in exchange that Fey would rise extensively through the ranks of the VF, becoming Schussnigg's new Vice Chancellor and seeing many of his counter-reforms implemented.\n \nImplicit in this deal, however, is Schussnigg's admission of his own defeat: defeat by the liberals and young reformers, who exploited and betrayed his trust, and now, betrayal by the conservatives, who stand poised to reverse every single one of his hard-won reforms. He's lost."
aut.43.a:0 "Reform was always doomed to fail..."
aut.44.t:0 "Fey's Request"
aut.44.d:0 "Our efforts to sideline and suppress the reformist Young Guard have indirectly been a great boost for the influence of the conservatives within our government, notably the old Heimwehr man Emil Fey, a hardliner who gravitated towards Schussnigg almost exclusively because of his contempt for Starhemberg.\n \nNow, greatly fearing the remaining influence of the Young Guard, Fey has requested that we go significantly further in our suppression of them, and begin to purge them outright. Many now believe that this is the only way we can properly escape from their influence and never-ending demands for democratization, but there are nonetheless a great many others who see such a move as needlessly tyrannical, arguing that we should instead move more subtly to begin dismissing and demoting them."
aut.44.a:0 "Fey's right, what's the harm?"
aut.44.b:0 "We can do this more quietly"
aut.46.t:0 "Compromise with the Young Guard"
aut.46.d:0 "Today, our efforts to reach a mutually favourable settlement with Figl and his fellow reformists have paid off. They have agreed to renounce their more overtly democratic rhetoric and requests, and in exchange will be allowed to continue their careers unimpeded. The deal, sealed today in a private meeting between Schussnigg and Figl, will ensure both the availability of countless talented administrators and the survival of Schussnigg's vision. We couldn't have hoped for a better outcome."
aut.46.a:0 "Thank God for that!"
aut.47.t:0 "Meeting the Aristocrats"
aut.47.d:0 "Today in Vienna, Starhemberg received a number of representatives of Austria’s many aristocratic families. The aristocracy has, for the most part, always supported the Standestaat, but many in the nobility were especially enthused by the ascent to power of Prince Stahrhemberg, himself the descendant of an ancient family.\n \nSurprising few, Starhemberg was able to find a great deal of common ground with the delegates, ensuring the aristocracy's support for new land reform and infrastructure programs in the countryside."
aut.47.a:0 "Excellent!"
aut.48.t:0 "The Reaining Moderates"
aut.48.d:0 "Although we have conclusively seen off Schussnigg's own attempts to take over the country, and have silenced any real calls for reform in the Standestaat, we cannot ignore that a large number of figures at various levels within the administration do still harbor reformist sympathies: we could never have purged every last supporter of Schussnigg, and many were able to hold on to their influence.\n \nHowever, as we further consolidate our power, we must decide what to do with them. Many believe that, as the crisis is long past, we should largely leave them be, allowing us to take advantage of their administrative talent, and without the threat of any real political challenge. However, many others still believe that we should be wary of reformist influence, so propose that we take a harsher approach, quietly demoting those whose loyalty can't be assured. Seeking to find a compromise, many others believe that we should let them continue their careers unimpeded, but on the condition of new assurances of their support for Starhemberg."
aut.48.a:0 "We're here to stay either way, leave them be"
aut.48.b:0 "As long as they toe the line, they can hold on to their jobs"
aut.48.c:0 "We have to take a harsher approach"
aut.49.t:0 "The Question of the Ostmarkisches Sturmscharen"
aut.49.d:0 "The Ostmarkisches Sturmscharen, like the Heimwehr, is  VF-aligned rightist paramilitary. However, its relations with the Heimwehr have never been easy: indeed, it was formed largely as a moderate alternative to the Heimwehr, and such figures as Schussnigg and Figl have been prominent in it. As such, now that we are in power, we now need to find a way to deal with this potentially untrustworthy element of the regime. Starhemberg's supporters have come up with two different proposals on how to do this. One is to replace the current leadership of the Sturmscharen with loyal Heimwehr men, allowing it to maintain its independence but firmly under our control. Others, meanwhile, want us to absorb it into the Heimwehr outright, ensuring that it won't ever be a threat to us."
aut.49.a:0 "Absorb it into the Heimwehr"
aut.49.b:0 "Just replace its leadership"
aut.50.t:0 "The Fate of the Sturmscharen Officers"
aut.50.d:0 "Now that we've absorbed the Ostmarkisches Sturmscharen into the Heimwehr, we must decide on our policy towards the organization’s commanders, who may well harbor more moderate sympathies than the main body of the Heimwehr. Some believe that, since Schussnigg's own efforts to take over have petered out, we should take a soft approach with them, giving us more access to their organizational and military abilities. Others, meanwhile, think we should demote most of them, but not let their careers be wasted outright, while some are calling on us to simply relieve them of their positions and let them find work elsewhere."
aut.50.a:0 "Leave them be"
aut.50.b:0 "Demote the ones we can't trust"
aut.50.c:0 "Purge them"
aut.51.t:0 "A New Leader for the Sturmscharen"
aut.51.d:0 "Now that we have decided to replace the leadership of the Ostmarkisches Sturmscharen, we must decide who to appoint as the organization’s new commander. Two candidates have emerged, both good Heimwehr men and staunch Starhemberg loyalists. Both Reinhart Bachofen von Echt and  Hans von Pranckh believe  that they will be able to steer the Sturmscharen in the right direction, each promising to make it all but a front for the Heimwehr. However, we must choose between the two."
aut.51.a:0 "von Echt will do well"
aut.51.b:0 "Pranckh is a better pick"
aut.52.t:0 "The Fate of Schussnigg"
aut.52.d:0 "While Schussnigg has had to give up his ambitions to take over the country, he is still minister for the interior, and does retain some influence within the state. Of course, this situation can't be allowed to last, and we must find something to do about Schussnigg.\n \nMany are thus calling on Stahrhemberg to fire him, using his undermining of the government during the crisis as justification. Others, however, are going further, arguing that Schussnigg should be arrested and tried, sending a very clear message that reform is off the menu. A small number of hardliners, meanwhile, are even proposing that Schussnigg have a tragic freak accident arranged for him..."
aut.52.a:0 "Just sack him, he can't do anything anyway"

aut.53.t:0 "Schussnigg Arrested"
aut.53.d:0 "Today, while on his way to the cabinet meeting, Kurt Schussnigg was stopped in the street by a large number of military policemen, flanked by Heimwehr. Charged on the spot with "subversion of the Austrian state", he was led away to a police station, and is now awaiting trial. His arrest has sent a clear message around the world that reform will not be accepted by the Austrian regime, and that Starhemberg alone is the leader of Austria. No doubt, this will greatly strengthen our hand."
aut.53.a:0 "I wonder what the judge's verdict will be..."
aut.54.t:0 "Schussnigg Dead!"
aut.54.d:0 "This morning, a tragic series of events took place. The government car carrying the Minister of the Interior, Kurt Schussnigg, crashed and exploded in the middle of Vienna, in what can only be explained as a freak accident of engineering. Although his driver thankfully survived with only minor burns, the explosion seems to have killed Schussnigg instantly.\n \nStarhemberg was quick to announce his condolences to Schussnigg's friends and family, despite the ramblings of a small number of madmen who are crazy enough to claim that he somehow ordered Schussnigg's death. Dubbed "conspiracy theorists" by the Vienna press, due to their belief in a conspiracy of sorts against the Minister, they are being ridiculed by much of the population.\n \nThe nation is saddened and shaken by the morning's events, but we are all glad to have a diligent and responsible leader such as Starhemberg at the helm to pick up the pieces left by the tragedy."

aut.56.t:0 "Monarchist Protests"
aut.56.d:0 "Until recently, almost all Austrian monarchists have staunchly supported the Standestaat. However, we have now alienated them deeply by failing to make any serious moves towards a restoration. And today, they came out in force in the streets of Vienna, openly condemning [ROOT.GetLeader] for his "cowardice and impotence" in failing to restore the monarchy, claiming that he is simply frightened of foreign powers' responses. Although we can easily clean up this damage in the short term, the monarchists' support won't be won back."

aut.57.t:0 "Otto von Habsburg Attracts Support"
aut.57.d:0 "In recent months, the pretender to the Austrian throne, Otto von Habsburg, has been able to greatly increase his support and traction among the people. The VF has always had a strong monarchist wing, especially among the Heimwehr and its supporters, while Schussnigg is also known to have sympathies with a restoration. As such, a great many figures within the government are now calling on us to arrange to meet with Otto, lest we alienate his supporters entirely."

aut.58.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] formally announced the repealing of the network laws that, since the declaration of the Austrian republic, have been used to suppress the House of Habsburg and their political influence. Although many countries in the region, who have long taken a firm stance against talk of a Habsburg Restoration, have condemned this move, it is clear that they lack the will to start a larger crisis, let alone war, and so we can proceed with our moves to a Restoration."
aut.58.a:0 "Excellent!"
aut.59.t:0 "The Habsburg Laws Strengthened"
aut.59.d:0 "Today, [ROOT.GetLeader] announced that the existing laws against the House of Habsburg's political influence, which have been in place since the declaration of the Austrian republic, would be further tightened and strenghtened. With the VF government having gone some way to alienate many Austrian monarchists before this turn of events, many saw this coming as a retaliation against them, but plenty are still surprised by this public move againt their political ambitions, while it is rumoured that Otto von Habsburg is considering leaving the country."

aut.61.d:0 "Today, it was announced to the nation that Austria's constitution had been amended - indeed, for the second time recently - to accommodate for a monarchy and to declare that Austria was indeed a monarchy, with its Emperor as Head of State. Although the Emperor will take many ceremonial duties from [ROOT.GetLeader] and come to represent the nation on par with him, it is still clear that [ROOT.GetLeader] will hold onto the real power in the nation.

In an extremely long and intricate service, His Majesty swore to defend Austria and its people always, and to always put God and His Church first. Across the country, the same ecstatic mood as when he was first declared Emperor has been awakened, with the people celebrating long into the night.\n \nGott erhalte, Gott beschutze\n \nUnser schone Osterreich..."
aut.63.a:0 "Long Live the Emperor!"
aut.64.t:0 "Heimwehr Units Resist"
aut.64.d:0 "In the aftermath of our seizure of power, units of the reactionary Heimwehr, across the country, have gone underground and formed into new resistance cells, hoping to undermine and eventually unseat the new government. This will be a major issue for us, and we shall have to act quickly to strike at the reactionary resistance."
aut.64.a:0 "We must crush them"
aut.65.t:0 "Forming a New Cabinet"
aut.65.d:0 "As we further consolidate our control in Austria, we shall need to reform our government from a loosely organized group of leftist militiamen under Renner, to a functioning and legitimate administration. As such, we shall have to assemble a proper republican cabinet, on the basis of those that existed before the Standestaat. Although a number of leftist and liberal parties will have to be invited into the emerging government, it is impossible to ignore the Kommunistische Partei Osterreichs, whose militiamen have played a vital role in our siezure of power, and which has long collaborated with us against the tyrants of the Standestaat. As such, we must invite their leader, Alfred Klahr, into the Austrian government."
aut.65.a:0 "Very well, invite Klahr into the government"
aut.66.t:0 "Policy Towards the Opposition"
aut.66.d:0 "As we further secure power across Austria, it is vital that we form our policy towards the various opposition movements in the country. It goes withoutb saying that the Vaterlandische Front will have to be banned and satmped out, but the cabinet is struglling to decide how to treat other smaller movements. While the more liberal figures in the government are adamant that we should defend free speech and assembly, the communists under Klahr are pushing for a harsher crackdown."
aut.66.a:0 "Crush the VF, but give minor leaders free speech"
aut.66.b:0 "We need to purge these reactionaries"
aut.67.t:0 "Fighting the Resistance"
aut.67.d:0 "With our men engaged in fighting the Heimwehr reistance and mopping up their cells, we need to work out our policy towards those fighting against us. Many in the SDAPO believe that if we announced an amnesty for those who lay down their arms now, we would be able to avoid a great deal of bloodshed, but Klahr's communists are urging us to simply intensify the crackdowns, crushing the reactionaries no matter what."
aut.67.a:0 "Offer an amnesty to those who surrender now"
aut.67.b:0 "We have to crush them, whatever it takes"
aut.68.t:0 "Fate of the Rightist Policemen"
aut.68.d:0 "As we seek to further legitimize our administration, we will need to use the police force to restore order. However, we cannot ignore the fact that, under the Standestaat, the police was actively used to suppress the workers, and many policemen have rather distasteful records of suppressing the movements that now control the country. Nonetheless, many in the SDAPO want us to leave these man be, arguing that they were simply doing their job, and that we have to focus on depoliticizing the police. Klahr's communists, however, are demanding that these man stand trial."
aut.68.a:0 "Keep them in their positions, but ensure that the police is depoliticized"
aut.68.b:0 "Try them for their crimes against the workers"
aut.69.t:0 "Using our paramilitaries"
aut.69.d:0 "As we further push the Heimwehr back with our paramilitary muscle, we need to decide which groups to prioritize in the restoration of order. So far, the SDAPO's Republikanischer Schutzbund has played the biggest role, but increasingly, with Klahr in the cabinet, the communist militias are also playing a major role, and some are now pressuring us to give the communist forces a greater part to play."
aut.69.a:0 "Prioritize the Schutzbund"
aut.69.b:0 "The Communist militias have a role to play too"
aut.70.t:0 "Renner's Speech"
aut.70.d:0 "Today in Vienna, with order and democracy well on its way to being restored, Karl Renner, father of the Austrian republic and veteran leader of the SDAPO, addressed the Austrian people, thanking them dearly for their assistance and aid during the fall of the tyranny of Dollfuss and restoration of the republic, and expressing his wish that they would continue to aid and support the government as it finished restoring stability to the nation, and rights to the people."
aut.70.a:0 "Hurrah!"
aut.71.t:0 "Figl Picks up the Pieces of the VF"
aut.71.d:0 "In the aftermath of our choice to allow free speech and assembly for more minor rightist politicians, a new party has emerged: the Osterreiches Volkspartei, led by Leopold Figl. Figl, formerly a bureaucrat in the Standestaat, and indeed a one-time protege of Engelbert Dollfuss, was nonetheless known for his reformism and democratic sympathies, and has now further affirmed his commitment to democracy. Nonetheless, many in the government, especially the communists, want us to stamp his movement out now, lest he revive the tyranny that we struggled so much to free ourselves from."
aut.71.a:0 "Allow him to operate"
aut.71.b:0 "Arrest this reactionary and his clique!"
aut.72.t:0 "The Rise of Riehl"
aut.72.d:0 "Our decision to permit rightist groups to continue to organize has massively played into the hands of Walter Riehal and his Pan-Germanist, nationalist, and anti-Semitic DNSAP, which is increasingly organizing and agitating, hoping to absorb much of the rightwing support that the VF commanded. Lest these unscrupulous reactionaries establish a new tyranny in Austria, many, especially Klahr and his associates, are urging us to ban the party and arrest Riehl, though others are arguing that we should be wary of becoming tyrants ourselves."
aut.72.a:0 "Allow him to operate"
aut.72.b:0 "Arrest this madman!"
aut.73.t:0 "The New Constitution Begins Drafting"
aut.73.d:0 "With stability having mostly returned to Austria, Renner today informed the cabinet that a new republican constitution would have to be drafted, as democracy is further restored. It is, however, inevitable that the different factions in the government will have very different visions for how this constitution should be structured, and we can expect Klahr and the KPO to push for a more authoritarian and socialist constitution, against our own wishes of a de facto restoration of the pre-1932 Republican constitution."
aut.73.a:0 "Let's see how this goes..."
aut.74.t:0 "Klahr's Gamble"
aut.74.d:0 "Today in the cabinet meeting, Alfred Klahr laid bare his demands. Until a true socialist constitution, modelled on those in the Netherlands, RSFR, or NGPU, is put in place, he and the KPO will boycott all government proceedings. Immediately after this announcement, he walked out of the room, alongside his fellow communists. This has thrown the government into crisis, and although Renner intends to push on with restoring the republican constitution, it is unclear whether or not he'll be able to without the support of his coalition partners."
aut.74.a:0 "How's this going to end...?"
aut.75.t:0 "Renner Gives In"
aut.75.d:0 "With communist pressure having grown to an unbearable extent, and legislative paralysis threatening our hold on power, Renner has finally given in to Klahr's demands, and has agreed to draft a truly socialist constitution, with a much greater leftist and authoritarian structure than the pre-1932 constitution of the Republic. This will inevitably pave the way for the consolidation of a communist state in Austria, but it seems that it has gotten too late for us to do anything to prevent this grim reality."
aut.75.a:0 "The future is Red!"
aut.76.t:0 "Klahr Gives In"
aut.76.d:0 "Finally, with his boycott of the government hurting his own influence more than it's hurting our ability to govern, Alfred Klahr has given up on his demands for a socialist constitution, and ended his boycott. With the communists having submitted to our agenda and resumed their place in our government, we can safely proceed with our restoration of the old republican constitution of Austria. With the communist challenge seen off, democracy can live another day."
aut.76.a:0 "Thank God for that!"
aut.77.t:0 "The Constitution Ratified"
aut.77.d.commie:0 "Today in Vienna, the new constitution of the Republic of Austria was formally ratified. Although many had hoped and expected for a democratic and republican constitution to be put in place, communist influence within the government has seen a much more blatantly authoritarian and socialist constitution put in place. With this great boon to the KPO's influence, many are now questioning whether Austrian democracy’s days are numbered, and just how free the forthcoming elections will really be."
aut.77.d.socdem:0 "Today in Vienna, the new constitution of the Republic of Austria was formally ratified. With communist efforts to force through a more openly socialist and authoritarian constitution having come to nothing, Renner has succeeded in essentially restoring a modified version of the old Republican constitution, as it existed before 1932 and the advent of the Standestaat. With elections forthcoming, it seems that democracy truly has returned to Austria."
aut.77.a:0 "For a brighter future!"
aut.78.t:0 "The Elections"
aut.78.d:0 "Today, the people of Austria will caste their votes for the first time since 1930. After many long months of chaos and rapid political change, few are sure what kind of Austria will emerge from the day's vote, but there can only be one winner in this historic contest to shape the future of Austria..."
aut.78.a:0 "Renner and the SDAPO win a clear victory!"
aut.78.b:0 "Figl and the OVP rally the Austrian right!"
aut.78.c:0 "Riehl and the DNSAP win a surprise victory!"
aut.78.e:0 "Amidst heavy "persuasion", Klahr and the KPO come out on top!"
