etr.1.t:0 "Pan But Not All"
etr.1.d:0 "The Turkic peoples of China have largely been a historical footnote up until this very point in history. They did not have great palaces, they did not have masterful poetry, they did not have fantastic technology or great cities. Their ancestors are largely only known by their bones and their pottery, their trash that they had left on the steppe long long ago. But this is the past that the anthropologist and the archaeologist sees, the past that belongs to the "scientist" and the "historian". This is not the true past of the Turkic peoples, we were born of the wolf mother, blessed with the blood of the canine and the spirit of the predator. We ravaged the great plains before our peoples settled down in Europe, Central Asia, and here, in China. In China we carved ourselves a Khanate whilst the Yuan played with their Chinese subjects and their Chinese religion. We, the children of the wolf, converted to the one true faith of Islam, and we stuck to our faith if not the orthodoxy of the Imams of Mecca. The Qing had never treated us with respect, but we had largely been able to maintain our autonomy until the revolution of 1911. The Chinese Republicans were obsessive, they wished for us to be their good little servants and "Civilized" men, wearing their slave collars they called ties. We rejected their modernism until it became forced on us, we had to learn how to read and how to talk in their disgusting tongue, our women had to walk in public, and our men had to work in factories and farms. When the government collapsed, we of course saw our chance to break free, and Muhammad Amin blessings be upon him showed us the way, we are not to reject the modernism but rather use it for the unity of the Turkic people. We will become a modern state so we can destroy the state of Iblis that is the Chinese government and all of the rebel forces who would dare chain us once again. Khoja Niyaz however spoke against this, he told us that we must take inspiration from the socialism and agrarianism of the left and the nationalism and traditionalism of the right to create a pure Uyghur state that will protect the poor and needy and our traditions for the sake of Allah. We have a long way to go and many struggles to get there, but inshallah we shall be victorious."
etr.1.a:0 "The Men of the Steppe Ride Again!"

etr.2.t:0 "Well That Didn't Take long"
etr.2.d:0 "Amin and Khoja stood across from each other in a flat plane on the holy steppe, horses behind each of them and swords draw. Despite the fact that the Turkic uprising was still at this point not much more then a regional flaring, the two men had seen to it to alienate each other and their respective factions to a point where working together was no long a viable opinion. To be fair their ideas were not really compatible, Amin was a Jadidist, a modernist who sought to form Turkestan into a European style, but also far right, Turkic state. A state that would fight west to unite all of the Turkic peoples of the world to the banner of Turan, and there would finally be peace as the steppe brotherhood would have finally come together. Khoja was strictly a Uyghur first, he did not consider the many peoples of the steppe to be his Turkic brothers, and he realized that a European style state would have no success with the devoutly Muslim and traditionalist Uyghurs. Rather they would take what they could from the left and the right, mixing both philosophies into a system that the Uyghur people could take pride in as their own. These two philosophers on how to run Turkestan could not work together, and the two men had fought each other over every policy and letter passed through the uprising's central command. Khoja would say that the women can take over essential duties of men, but they must remained veiled, while Amin would say that women cannot be trusted with hard labor, but that the veil is an icon of superstition. Progressive Traditionalism versus Conservative Modernism, although an unusual contradiction it is no shock as to why now the two men face each other down with swords. Amin charged first, swinging his blade at Khoja's shoulder, but he managed to overswing and find his sword in the dirt. Khoja hit back, cutting the cheek of Amin and causing him to scramble back. Khoja was certainly a more experienced sword fighter, he had been a raider for years, but he did not expect what came next. Amin, unable to pick his sword back up, charged Khoja and tried to tackle him, which resulted in..."
etr.2.a:0 "Khoja slicing his head off with one clean strike, the new cut down by the old."
etr.2.b:0 "Amin tackling Khoja and stabbing him with his own sword, here lies the noble savage."

etr.3.t:0 "For Our Faith and Our People"
etr.3.d:0 "The sun rose over the great and holy steppe, the great blue sky shining on the many inhabitants that lived in this brave new world. Although the war was not won, the people of Turkestan swung their heads to the dawn and internalized hope, hope for a new age of their traditions and their progress. They looked over the new communal farms and fields that graced the lands of Turkestan, bringing food and harvest to the people and security to all who lie within its borders. They looked to the new Mosques and Islamic Schools which now graced the countryside like elegant spots of Allah's grace and love to the people of the world. They looked to the long stretches of steppe, left undisturbed by city and by man, to forever more hold the people of the Uyghur people in peace and freedom. Khoja had made peace with many, against the evil of Dai Li and Chiang, Khoja is a great savior of mankind, against the evil of Mao and Puyi, Khoja is a great liberator of mankind. These enemies surrounded us, they tried to destroy us, but instead what was left was the great lands of Allah that shine gold like the grandest palace of old. Shame on he who disrespects our traditions, but shame on he who can not recognize progress and the validity it can hold. Our medicine might not be the most advanced, nor our tactics, but we are a happy and proud people. We hold our faith close to our hearts and we shun the influence of iblis and the demons who try and infiltrate our lands. We, the Uyghur people, shall again march alone against the forces of Jahannam, and we shall again be victorious as our sabers are sharp and our horses are swift. For our faith and our people, our victory shall be eternal, and we shall march into paradise with a parade of fallen warriors and epic battles, something that shall be sung of and spoken of in awe for generations to come! Allahu Akbar, God is the Greatest!"
etr.3.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

etr.4.t:0 "For the Dream of a United Turan"
etr.4.d:0 "We are one of the many Turkic peoples who live in this world. Our victories have shown us again and again that we cannot be fooled by critics and petty bastards who seek to tell us that our vision is "unrealistic". We shall spread the brotherhood of Turan and unite the Children of the Wolf once again, and the Turkic peoples will once again live together as brothers and fight the world together instead of apart. Against these incredible odds, against the Communists and the Nationalists and the Demons and the Qing, we have been victorious and we will continue to be victorious. We shall end this war with a sword in our hands and infinite scorn in our hearts, for we do not love the enemy nor do we feel any sense of empathy towards them. We have the blood of wolves, we are predators, and we shall drain the blood of the Chinese lambs will all of our might until our thirst is satiated and our bellies are full. They deserve nothing less, because despite what they think they are nothing but sheep. It is the job of the Turkic people to bring the Chinese into the 20th century, kicking and screaming, bleeding and dying. It is what our ancestors would have done, and although many Chinese will surely die, it is a risk that we, the great Turkic people, are willing to make. The Islamists complain and cry about our lack of charity and forgiveness, but forgiveness is an old tradition that like many others must be forgotten for the Turkic people to emerge from the smelly gangrene of Feudalism into the bright enlightenment of the modern day. We have destroyed their Mosques and built hospitals, we have cleared their fields and build roads and industry, we have replaced the cavalryman with the infantryman, all in the name of modernity and the advancement of our people. These traditions had their place, but they belong no longer in the nation of Turks, children of the wolf, men with canine blood."
etr.4.a:0 "Children of the Wolf"

etr.5.t:0 "Of Guns and Horses"
etr.5.d:0 "It is a frank statement of economics that we do not currently possess much in the way of firearms, nor do we own much in the way of the production of firearms. In fact, the total number of guns of any decent quality we own are in the hundreds, if you count muskets, the thousands. Although we are fighting a modern war, we do not have the ability to arm ourselves for one, so from this we have two choices. Either we can try at all costs to purchase, produce, or find guns to fill the gaps, or, we can embrace the traditional cavalry warfare of our ancestors. Although the later might seem silly to some, the forces we currently fight are barely better in equipment then we are, and we have plenty of horses and experienced horsemen to create a horde to truly challenge that of a Khan. Embracing the traditional ways of war might be advantageous in the short term, but in the long term we would be unable without great difficulty to reform our army into a modern fighting machine. However as previously stated, the only way we could attempt to form a modern army now would be through the mass looting of our nation and purchase of black market firearms, neither of which makes our country come across as legitimate, nor does it make our government seem trustworthy. There is no truly correct answer, but a consensus must be reached..."
etr.5.a:0 "Rifles and bullets, civilization."
etr.5.b:0 "Consequences be damned, Allahu Akbar!"

etr.6.t:0 "Modernity and Tradition"
etr.6.d:0 "The ignorant Turanists had attempted to make a pathetic reconstruction of the great western armies, with patchwork uniforms and rifles held together by spit and faith alone. They had nearly doomed our great revolt with their obsession with the ways of the Christian and the West, so called Muslims only in name. We understand that their ways are nothing but pathetic and false, and so by the grace of Allah the most compassionate and merciful we have found the solution to the issue of modernity. We have found and killed all officers who dared participate in the charade of modernity, and reformed all possible soldiers into horsemen of the great army of the steppe and the army of Allah the most compassionate and merciful. We shall sell our rifles and in their place purchase numerous pistols and swords for our cavalry, as well as donating money to the mosques of our nation. All modernist theorists shall have their heads cut off or be exiled, and all attempts to use the latin alphabet shall be stopped. Modernity shall conquer no more of the holy lands of Allah the most compassionate and merciful, and we shall push the devils back, for the land of Allah the most compassionate and merciful is the whole world!"
