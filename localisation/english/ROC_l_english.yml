roc.1.t:0 "Red Star and the Blue Sun"
roc.1.d:0 "The profound victory of Doctor Sun Yat-sen over the Imperial Forces of China flew over like a wave, the people had finally won their freedom against the evil tyranny of the foreign forces of the Qing. At last China held its head high, the Dragon once again towering over the east. Then after this fantastic victory and the first election in 1925, Sun Yat-sen, the Red General, the President of China, promptly collapsed and died of the cancer he had kept secret from the nation. The next day as his wife read his will, it was laid out that to avoid the right wing of the Kuomintang taking power in a election, he had run for office himself, knowingly dying soon into his reign but leaving the Left KMT leader Wang Jingwei as President. The right wing attempted an uprising against what they felt was a bastardization of democracy, but Wang managed to crush their forces and hold onto power. His regime saw the implementation of Georgian land reform, the nationalization and expansion of the rail system, a massive increase in literacy and education within the country, and a peaceful if slow development of the economy. But as the next election neared, Wang feared his popularity would not be sufficient, and so in a desperate bid allied with the Communist Party of China, who had united with the KMT in 1923 but then split after Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925. The Communists pushed the vote solidly in favor of Wang, with the 1929 elections having 63% of the vote going to the Left KMT and Communist coalition. The Communist-KMT alliance proved itself to be a resounding success despite the early ideological difficulties that plagued the first year of co-policy, as the Communist formed peasant communes that were largely self sufficient while Wang's government managed to develop the major cities that dotted the coast of China. Industry flourished as foreign investors flooded into the country, but were regulated by the strong guiding hand of the Wang regime. It is now 1936, the Communist-KMT alliance is at its height and the people are slowly but surely pushing China to becoming a power to rival Europe in strength. But there are whispers of discontent, the Right KMT has accused the government of rigging elections and mass repressions, whispers of Qing restorations trickle in from Manchuria, and the Wang government has not been friendly to the Turkic peoples or their faith of Islam. Still, it for now seems as if nothing can go wrong."

Our enemies speak of honor but they do not understand it, you, my fellow worshippers of the liberator, must enact that honorable death among China with a viciousness that shall not be seen again for hundreds of years.

roc.6.d:0 "Wang Jingwei had been celebrating the Chinese new year at his home in Beijing with many of his cabinet ministers and members of his party. He and several others went to the balcony to greet the citizens who were also celebrating the new year of the Rat. Wang and his friends, all very drunk, greeted the citizens with great kindness and joy. But what was about to unfold, was quite the contrast. As Wang and his posse went to head back into the home, they heard several gunshots, and then the sound of a gargantuan explosion, followed by many bloodcurdling screams. Wang quickly turned around and looked back, only to see that the streets in front of his home were now painted red with blood and gore. A large black spot laid in the center of the road, with various body parts and vicera pinned to the walls of the surrounding buildings or charred and melted to the street itself. Men and women who had not been immediately killed walked aimlessly, missing body parts and blackened by the explosion and burns. The carnage was simply astounding. He tried his best not to throw up, but the sickening scenes he had just seen convulsed in his mind and forced him to vomit. The gunshots and explosions could still be heard, but they were now coming from afar. The air had a stench of guts and smoke from the guns and explosion. These attacks could only be traced back to one group: Dai Li, and his supporters. This was clear to Wang almost instantly. Wang ran up to his home's second floor patio to get a better view of the carnage, but that's when the second explosion occurred. The blast from it levelled Wang's home. Search teams spent all night looking for his body in the rubble, but to no success. It seems as though the year of the Rat has gone off to a terrible start..."

roc.7.d:0 ""My dear countrymen, we, the government of China, can only speak with the heaviest of hearts, as we announce the death of the beloved President Wang Jingwei. We are currently not aware if who has committed such an atrocity, but the good members of the Citizen's Police are combing the world for any information as to their whereabouts. If you have critical information on the assassins or any other tips, please visit your local Police Station for a reward on any information that could lead to the arrest of these terrorists." The Radio was switched off as 10 men sat alone in a smokey boardroom, their used cigarettes massing into a ever larger pile on what was presumably an ashtray a few days ago. After the death of President Wang, the remnants of the Chinese government that were not killed in the horrific explosion had grasped with no luck on what they could do against this total disaster. Wang had been the only thing keeping the Army, the Nationalists, and the Communists working together, and now he was dead, buried under a ton of sot and burnt wood. Chiang had tried to take power in the days following the coup, but the "Emergency Committee" as they were now called had flatly rejected these attempts. They had no illusions about the motivations Chiang truly held, he was a snake in the grass and probably was involved in Wang's death in the first place! But they had no leads, no way to try and consolidate a strong base or find a way to smoke the assassin out. These men of the Committee had only been what was left, with the highest among them being the Minister of Agriculture, the rest of the higher cabinet had also been blown up in the party that Wang had been throwing during the new year's celebrations. So the Chinese government stood at a standstill, waiting for a tip to leap upon."

The letter was opened, and within minutes that letter was being transcribed to the central police department, then the local government, then the Emergency Council. It was directions, very detailed directions at that, which indicated the exact position of one man named Dai Li, who in the letter was named as the head terrorist behind the New Years massacre as many had come to call it. It described his collaborators, his suppliers, and every name one could possibly want, each and every one of them with instructions how to find them. The letter was simply marked, "A Friend", but it didn't matter who sent it, the exact thing the Emergency Council had been looking for had fallen in their lap, and they weren't about to look a gift horse in the mouth! In that smokey room the council partied in memory of Wang and for the fortune of the gods that had just shined upon them, I mean how lucky could they be? They just knew that there would be absolutely no backfiring of this whatsoever!"

roc.9.d:0 "The Shanghai radio faded in and out in the old bar that Jiang and his buddies hung out in, it was a stinky old hole in the wall where the paint was peeling and the beer was watery, but it was as close to home as any of these men had. They were all public workers, employed by one of the many state owned corporations set up by Wang during his tenure as president, and they were damn proud of it. Being a public worker meant Unionization, it meant better wages, and it meant they didn't have to work for some western bastard from London. Jiang and his friends were socialists, and due to their education they had been able to work in one of the public factories that were opening up around Shanghai. They had always been strong supporters of Wang's coalition as all the socialists had been, so when the shock of Wang's death hit them, Jiang could hardly stand up straight. The one half decent leader China had had for hundreds of years, and some demon thinks he can just knock him off and get away with it? Well he and his friends were listening in closely to the radio announcement, they had been tipped off through the grapevine that they had caught the Devil, the Soul Eater Dai Li, and were announcing his capture on the 6:00 PM news announcement. They huddled around, "Citizens of China, it is with our most glorious and proud words that we can say the demon Dai Li has been captured by our brave policemen and government forces a few days ago. He has been seen in a court and proclaimed guilty on all counts in a record two hours, and has been set to be hung next year. Let us all rejoice at the capture of the criminal and bandit who dared to harm our precious nation. This operation was coordinated by the General Chiang Kai-Shiek, who has consistently proclaimed sole responsibility for the capture of Dai Li to our reporters on the scene. As this crisis comes to a close, we must ask, who shall be the new president of China, and will the fragile coalition hold?"."

roc.10.t:0 "There goes the Neighborhood"
roc.10.d:0 "After the complete lack of a response by Chiang at the bombing of Chengdu, the communists felt as if they could act with impunity towards their primarily current target, Shanghai. Despite the nominal Capital being within Beijing, the Nationalists had centred their power base within Shanghai and fortified the city into a castle for Chiang and his cronies. This "castle" was supposed to be solid as a rock, with 24 hour patrols and strict curfews. At least that is what the Nationalists had come to believe in their short time in power, they still continued to believe that they were untouchable despite all of the evidence pointing to the contrary. Socialist Partisans managed to neutralize the outer city guards by baiting them out with a few well placed coins and ambushing them, then after taking their uniforms they took their place in the guard. Then, the gates free to the socialists, thousands of partisans were simply driven in by trucks while dressed as civilians. Taking their time, the partisans moved slowly into the administrative and military section of the city, eating in the shops that lined the streets and taking in the sights to better blend in. Slowly, but surely, the partisans managed to meet up in the central region of the city, taking bombs and pistols they had hidden in their clothes and bags and getting to work. All at once, the partisans jumped into action, setting bombs on ever major building they could find as well as the military barracks, setting the timers for roughly ten minutes. As the bombs were craft made their reliability was not stellar, but in five minutes the partisans had managed to plant all that they needed to and fled for their trucks. The police did happen to notice the bombs, but like in Chengdu it was far, far to late to be able to stop their detonation. As central Shanghai exploded into a mass of warm tones, the partisans drove away back to their home in Sichuan, simply waiting for the order to be given and the revolution to begin. Needless to say the Crisis of Shanghai managed to further destroy the almost entirely destroyed reputation of Chiang's government, and many of his generals and governors are starting to ignore his direct orders, doing what they feel is best for their region of the country. Doom has come, a spiral of failure, and there was nothing the government could do but sit and watch and sip their tea."
roc.10.a:0 "Shit"

roc.11.t:0 "Much Anarchy, Much Justice" 
roc.11.d:0 "It was a quiet day in Chengdu, well, as quiet as it can be when your country is on the brink of civil war and your province is the epicentre of all communist activity in the country. The buses still ran, the administrative offices did their work, the factories produced and chugged along. The day continued as it had for the last few years in the ancient city, but there was something odd in the air. Suddenly the police station got a report, there was a fire along the administrative district, building after building catching fire as the whole of the city rose from it's daily routine into a panic. Explosions could be heard from the decaying and poorly painted police station as the entire skyline of half the city turned into a orange hued hell. Right as the Police department was about to send it's men out, a ticking could be heard from directly outside of the building, in the opposing passage leading into the alleyway. As the men of the police station investigated the sound, they found a single man, dressed in a industrial smock painted in a ugly mix of greys and oranges, fiddling around with a suitcase. The police asked for him to put his hands up, in which the mysterious man's response was to pull a pistol and clip one of the investigating officers in the shoulder, disappearing into a nearby alleyway. A few of the cops followed him, shouting and firing their guns, while the rest stayed behind to investigate the strange suitcase. As they did the ticking slowed down, it's cadence becoming slower and slower until it finally stopped. As the ticking stopped the police station and all of the police within found their bodies a neat paste on the nearby walls or crushed beneath the rubble of the building. Perhaps it would have been worth it to invest in bomb identification training, but it seems like that is moot by this point. The Socialists have finally organized to a point where an attack of this scale is viable, and the country teeters ever closer to total and utter war. Of course when Chiang heard the news, he believed that the fires and bombings had been the result of the incompetence of his own men rather then his policies feeding the ranks of these partisans. It seems like despite this shock, the Chinese government would not be responding in any true sense to the attack, this being exactly what Mao had been testing for."

roc.12.d:0 ""You have to actually be shitting me, there is no way in no universe under heaven that fucking Chiang could be appointed president by a council of fucking socialists!" Mao threw the newspaper across the hostel room, both him and Deng had agreed to meet there in dire situations that would require leaving their government posts in Beijing. Mao had been the master of records within Wang's government, a job he had taken too quite well since his early days as a library clerk, and he had been satisfied with his position. He had been a member of the Communist party nearly since it had been founded through his dedicated involvement in the New Culture movement, and had been one of the strongest proponents of Nationalist-Communist unity since the very beginning. His loyalty had won him friends and enemies, but he had managed to secure relatively high government office in his 30s thanks to that very loyalty, as well as some well written critiques of classical Chinese culture. The other man standing across from Mao couldn't be more different except for in his loyalty to his cause, Deng had been one of the members of the Communist Party who had supported a transitional economic period, believing that through rapid industrialization and the advancement of technology China could become a superpower. This view was unpopular with many, as it would sidestep the common farmer and instead bring a new industrial working class to bear. Deng had been appointed Assistant Minister of Economics despite his age, and many had claimed that China's policy under the last few years of Wang were directly influenced by his ideas. Both of these men stood across from each other in a dirty Hotel room, and both knew the struggle that was coming to greet them in the future. The bastard Chiang had taken power, and with him the coalition had collapsed and the Communists and Socialists expelled from the government all but officially.Unlike many of their other comrades however, these two had a plan."

Any symbol or icon that could remotely be seen as socialistic was destroyed, all left wing books were burnt, all of this while the police stood by and could do nothing to help. Some police of course did try to protect what they could, such as Officer Yuan Lee, who tried to fight off two members of the Blue Shirts from burning down a coffee shop in Beijing that had used a red star in its logo. He managed to beat the two away after a quick scuffle, but the following hour was beaten and "arrested" by a mob of 10 or so Blue shirts. Seeing the writing on the wall, many of the country's intellectuals, leftists, and politicians went underground or overseas, predicting the ensuing violence that will overtake China. The no so lucky people were paraded in the street, with men and women being beaten until bloody and some even murdered. The sheer brutality on display on the streets of China was so horrific it managed international news, which the name "Chiang" both in and outside of China gradually being seen as that of a monster. The Blue Terror had begun in China, and it seemed like any hope of a bright future was being thrown into the fire alongside Das Kapital and On Liberty."

roc.14.d:0 "Hundreds of thousands of men and women are now marching in Bejing, China, they hold the banners of the now banned Hammer and Sickle and the Red Star, and they demand justice for Wang and the removal of Chiang as president of China. They have covered the city with their slogans and their flags and their books, and they seem to have no sense of slowing down. Many people in the Bejing police have joined the protesters on their side, demanding that Chiang steps down from his office and is arrested for his crimes against the legitimate government of China! They are crying for blood, and Chiang knows it, he knows how much the people hate him, and he is desperately trying to think of a solution. How had Wang managed to keep these people in line for so long? It seemed that every policy he enacted to save China, the people would rebel against it and ruin everything! The obvious conclusion, Chiang observed, is that the Chinese people are merely too ignorant to be allowed to have a say either way in the matter. Wang only managed to hold onto power by placating the people and playing on their fears and wants, he was nothing but a manipulator and there had clearly been nothing else to his success as president. As Chiang continued this line of thought the protesters managed to reach their way into Tiananmen Square, they began to crowd around the palace, the palace that Chiang happened to currently be inside of. They demanded that the guards let them in so they could have a "Talk" with their beloved president, but the guards, who were loyal Blue Shirts, stood their ground. Before him Chiang had a choice, he could call in the army to neutralize the issue or he could hope and pray that his own people wouldn't kill him.Although the military option sounded preferable, it would also turn even most of the military against him as his popularity continued to tumble. Letting the protesters burn off their steam would put his life at risk and help the socialists spread their message, but it would also allow for the retention of even a small amount of military loyalty within the army."

roc.15.d:0 "General Zhu De had been a military officer nearly all of his life. He had joined the Imperial Army at the age of 20 after finishing his imperial examination, and his successes in the minor bandit conflicts of the 1900s had led him to further glory and prestige within the Armed forces. During the 1912 revolution against the Qing, he had sided with the rebels at his first chance as a lowly officer and rose the ranks once again, becoming a Major and crushing the cursed Qing forces whenever they had shown their heads. During the Yuan Shikai coup attempt in 1915, he helped crush it, and the presidency of Sun Yat-sen was continued without much military issue until his sudden death in 1925. In his years under Yat-sen Zhu had believed China had found a true president, but afterwards President Wang took the throne of power. Zhu had mixed feelings of Wang, although his administration had been successful economically and to a lesser degree socially, it had also been corrupt and a unstable coalition, its continuation happening largely only through Wang's personal charisma. Zhu had long believed his death or deposement would result in the destruction of China unless an heir was appointed before his death, and it turned out he was correct. Now with that bastard Chiang, well Zhu had never had respect for Chiang, the man had coordinated with the Japanese heavily in the days after the revolution, to what end was unknown. It was even said that Chiang organized the Yuan coup attempt, although all evidence to such a case was conjecture at best. Well in his mad reign of power, Chiang had destroyed not only the great nation of China but the legacy of Sun Yat-sen, the man that Zhu had risked it all for. Another pathetic attempt at an emperor had poked his head from the shadows to try and take over everything the Chinese people loved, to throw a black curtain of shame over the pride of the people. Zhu had made his choice, he spoke to his soldiers calm manner and without flourish, speaking of the injustice and cruelties of the Chiang regime and how it betrayed the values of all that he and his soldiers had fought for. He then told his soldiers to board their trucks, and that they were going to fight this regime by going to the revolutionaries who now patrolled almost all the mountains of China and joining their just cause. The people would be free again. Across all of China the majority of the National Revolutionary Army fled to the hills to join their organization of choice, it seems like the Republic's days are numbered."

Well this little muckraking revolutionary will soon be of no issue, as Chiang ordered the Blue Shirts to find him and his lackey Deng and execute them both. Unfortunately for Chiang however, Mao and Deng had already fled to the western region to form and prepare for the coming civil war which by this point almost everyone could see coming. Chiang however, in his hubris, continued to search, and by search I mean burn and rape, the eastern countryside. Much of the peasantry were forced into being refugees, with many of them fleeing Chiang's wrath and joining the newly formed Red Army. These peasants were not joining out of political belief as much as pure pragmatism and survival, as Mao had promised the peasants a much, much better deal, and ever the opportunistic people these Chinese farmers took it. The local government of the west had long tired of Chiang's rage and brutality, and in an attempt to avoid bloodshed hid the presence of the Chinese communists within its borders, again out of pragmatism and survival rather then ideological fervor. It would be better to let the Communists build their little farming communes and tool workshops then let the central government destroy their entire region, so the presence of Mao and Deng was tolerated as long as they kept a low profile.

roc.17.d:0 "Well this was unexpected, a force of mixed Japanese and Manchu forces have invaded from Manchuria, claiming the mandate of heaven and their rightful place as the rulers of China. They are nominally led by the Emperor, or Former Emperor, Puyi, although any actual leadership from him is obscured under hundreds of layers of advisers and bureaucrats. Most believe he is nothing but a figurehead, some have even speculated the man is a falsification outright, with the child-emperor Puyi having died sometime after the Revolution. Whatever the case may be, those who are claiming to be the Qing empire have taken the capital of Beijing out of the hands of Dai Li's horrible regime, which had been running the region as essentially an autonomy since Chiang released him from prison. Due to this, the Resorationists were accepted by the local people as a preferable alternative to the sheer brutality and insanity of Dai Li, and the profound idiocy and incompetence of the Chiang Regime. The Imperial Army marched into the city with it's banners high, something that for many had not been seen in decades, and escorted the emperor Puyi to a stage which had actually been created the day before. This was a parade and a performance, in fact the Qing Restorationists had occupied the city days before, but the propaganda value of having the Emperor actually speak to the people was too immense to not pull out all the stops. But as the Emperor stood before the crowd, he began to speak dry words, words that were almost clearly not his nor anywhere near his will. To many of the onlookers he looked as if he had seen his child die in front of him, distraught at the actions which had been done in his name. Of course the official propaganda footage would be edited as would the posters, but those who saw him that day could not forget the sadness in his eyes. If they would have known what Puyi was thinking, they would have significantly less confidence in the new Imperial government then they currently did, but that is exactly the reason Puyi was not allowed to actually speak his mind. He had recently begun to question his legacy due to a new teacher in his inner circle and a new found passion, but to him it wouldn't matter. He was a puppet on strings, his opinions had no value and his will had no strength."

Within days of his release Dai Li had already started consolidating and forming his own private army, and soon after that swept into the northern mountainous region of China, decrying the Republic of China as weak and westernized and instead embracing a bastardized form of traditional Chinese folk religion which emphasised the doom of humanity, decay, and death. Using his shadowy position and notorious name to form a Cult-State, Dai Li consolidated his gains quickly, only losing a part of their eastern provinces to a Qing restorationist movement. His personal militia, the Dare to Die corp, have massacured any dissent against his rule, and shrines to folk personifications of death have been set up as state mandated public property. It seems like Chiang's gamble has failed in such a fantastically horrible way that his reputation will never recover, but rest assured his decisions will most probably only get much, much worse."

In front of him laid a choice between pragmatic power move and the maintenance of the smallest element of his legitimacy. Chiang could sacrifice his legitimacy for the help of the Demon Dai Li as the people called him, or he could leave him to rot, allowing there to at least be an element that he had not murder Wang himself. Dai Li was hated by the people, in fact the sheer hatred towards him could not be emphasised merely with thoughts or words, it laid at such a deep and emotional level that it would take a team of professional mental excavators to even try to breach the depths of the hatred. But he was useful, every mission he organized succeeded, every moment he repressed a group they would almost never find themselves in the public eye again, he was efficiency made manifest in the form of a man. Oh what to do, in his younger age Chiang would have been able to bark the order without a second thought, but as he aged he realized that his power had been based on nothing but violence on blood. He did not have supporters, he had collaborators, the people who helped him did so because they actively feared him, not one person was truly loyal to him in any sense. Chiang sat down on a chair within the room facing the barred window in the visitor's center, he lit up a cigarette and contemplated his options with a clearer head. He reminded himself of the mantra he had learned long ago when he had travelled with San Yat Seen, it is better to be feared then to be loved. If he would have to kill millions to maintain his power, he would, because he and he alone is the best option for China. Dai Li was merely another tool in maintaining his rule of fear. Chiang had made up his mind, he yelled at the prison guards: "Free him, and bring him to me!"."

roc.20.d:0 "The explosion destroyed the presidential residence in an instant, like the legends of old the great unifier of China fell on the blade of the demon, and China again would never know peace. Chiang Kai-Shek managed to swoop into power like a vulture seeking the carrion of war, taking the position of president in a barely veiled coup against the remnants of Wang Jingwei, the one man who had managed to have the communists and nationalists exist side by side. His immediate power grab was seen as suspicious by everyone in China, no peasant doubted his treachery and serpentine ways, but by blood Chiang tried to hold on despite his almost universally hated nature. He instituted the One Thousand Pedals initiative to "Clean China of the dirty pedals which now littered it's lands", Chiang had promised that only one thousand pedals, also known as human beings in this case, would need to be swiped away. This was a lie, this was a horrific lie, gangs of Blue Shirt thugs roamed the countryside in the days following the coup, massacring village after village in an attempt to purge the lands of anybody who would dare oppose the rule of Chiang. Unfortunately for Chiang however, all this did was rouse nearly the entire population of the country against him and his Blue Shirts. In an attempt to consolidate power further, he freed the man who had assassinated Wang, Dai Li, and appointed him as his temporary Secretary of Internal Peace and Stability. Dai Li immediately used this power to form a splinter state in the north of the country, calling Chiang a pathetic worm who was unable to do what needed to be done to form a truly pure China. The communists finally rose in the west after this, calling on the peasantry to resist the horrible machinations of the Snake Chiang and the Demon Dai. Qing restorationists rose in the northeast against Dai Li's "National Republic", claiming again the mandate of heaven and calling on the banners to once again unite against the demons which had plagued this land so much for so long. Finally in the far west, the great lands of the Turkic peoples of China raised their swords once again for the will of Allah, striking down against Chiang and his state of Iblis. It appears absolutely everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong, China is again broken and tattered, its blood soaking the fields and rivers it calls its own. Is there no hope for peace, or will China rise again from the ashes, as it always has, to a brighter future?"

roc.21.d:0 "At the onset of the Chiang regime many laborers from all across China had worried that the rights they had fought for under Wang and his coalition would be lost. Chief among these rights that were feared for were twofold, the rights of workers and the rights of women. Chiang in his infinite wisdom has decided to force through a mandate that all work days must be at least 14 hours a day per law. This has been met with, let's say, a small amount of controlled push back on the side of the population of China. Massive riots have broken out throughout the country, and dozens if not hundreds are now presumed dead. In almost every major city the walls are battered and the glass is broken, carnage and blood wash through the streets of China as the police in most cases have joined the rioters and protesters against the Chiang regime. Currently the only force loyal to Chiang is his beloved blue shirts and parts of the army, both of which have been desperately trying to maintain order, with Beijing especially having become a center of street fighting and barricades. If we do not act fast, then a new Chinese revolution very well may start! But Chiang has to ponder his options, he could simply crush the forming rebellion as it is young, destroying at least this section of opposition as much as he could before turning his attention elsewhere. This could severely hamper our political opposition, but it will also make us devils in the eyes of both our neighbors, the west, and our own people. We could try and mediate the issue, negotiating with the rioters to reduce the work hours to an amount that would still satisfy the government. If we do negotiate, no party will end up being happy, as the workers will still have raised hours and we will not have raised our work efficiency to any terrible degree. Of course there is a third option, we can restore the Wang era 8 hours a day law, which would most probably end many of the riots right here and now and salvage our international reputation. Of course by doing so we will strength the opposition and be seen as weak, but trying to raise the working hours probably wasn't the best idea in the first place regardless. Despite it all, Chiang..."

roc.22.d:0 "Chiang had realized the military incompetence of the Nationalist Army the moment he had taken power. Wang was a weak leader, as a rule, and had refused to expand the Military academy or the officer corp despite repeated petitions to do so. Wang had always thought that giving the people food and housing was more important then the military, but in times of war who would protect that food and housing? Still, there had been a reasonable amount of officers that Chiang could have picked from to become his second in command on military matters, but unfortunately it seemed as if almost every officer within the country did not want to take a position next to or in a five mile radius of Chiang. Through weeding his way through the available officers, Chiang was able to find two of a high ability who were willing to work with him, and so he invited them to his presidential palace to compete for the position. Xue Yue was the first to present his beliefs on how an army should be run, and it was quite a way indeed. Yue supported a massive conscription drive of all the physically best men in China, with a reserve drive of almost every single man in China, as well as the mass standardization of military equipment into just one uniform, one gun, and one system. It might not be popular with the people, but this system would allow for both a massive army and a large scale standard of discipline and equipment that would be, if not high quality, then functional. Additionally Yue gave arguments in favor of using massive waves of men to crash onto enemy lines, which would overwhelm the enemy by sheer force of will and cause them to retreat. Again, although not popular this tactic would manage to be effective in the style of warfare that China would most likely be seeing in the future. Wei Lihuang, the other officer aspiring to be second in command, gave a radically different perspective on how the war should be fought. To Lihuang war is a mass of defence interrupted by the occasional assault of either side. Through the mastery of defensive tactics and counter attacks, the war could easily be won, possibly with minimal casualties if played right. This might not be as brutally or immediately effective as Yue's tactics, but it would be vastly more tolerated by the people of China. Lihuang also supports the formation of specialized units within the army to perform specialized functions, rather then mass standarization. Hearing both sides, Chiang made his choice..."

Wei understood the need for regional differences in units in many respects, but he also wasn't an idiot, he knew their needed to be some kind of standard among the units of the Republic of China. That standard would of course be loyalty and training, even if the equipment could not always match, every Chinese solider will be a stout lion who would never back now in the face of fear or death. Warriors like the Chinese soldiers of old, protecting the modern people of China from the barbarism of the bandit hordes that now encompassed China. Unity in purpose and unity in morale, that is the true strength of an army, no matter the weapons they hold or the armor they wear, lions will always fight as lions. It is from this defensive mindset that the doctrine of Lihuang arises, his central thesis on the matter of warfare and its way to victory and success. Wear the enemy down, protect the people under you, never back down from your enemy and show only strength. Lihuang of course had his sympathies will all the factions of the civil war as well, of course apart from Dail Li. The Communists were fighting for what they saw as right, and Lihuang himself had flipped through a few Marxist books in the past. The Qing were just trying to restore their traditions, a noble idea if entirely misguided, and the Turkics were simply trying to find a home in a nation of Han and Infidels. Lihuang's empathy allowed him to understand the enemy on a deep level, and to anticipate their moves and actions without needing to risk the life of a valued spy. He had learned from Sun Tzu, to know the enemy is to know victory, and he planned as always to take that to heart, and show the world the glory of China and its army, the defender of the people and the protector of the nation."

Like all the others he was shoved into a conscription truck and drove off to one of the dozens of new training camps set up by Xue Yue in his ambitious "Ten Million Bodies" campaign. To Yue the essence of warfare was in the end blood, and the side with the greater amount of blood to shed always came out victorious. So mass conscription of all over the age of 21 and under the age of 30 has been enacted throughout the entirety of the lands the Nationalists control, leading to a gigantic influx of soldiers, yes, as well as a gigantic influx of dissent. Not to mention the state of the economy and education as a result of much of its youth being sucked away for two years required service for citizenship. Of course those youth and adults in a or with family in positions of importance would need not worry, nor would the college students and factory workers either, as Yue had made sure to only conscript those who could not and would not fight back, like the peasantry and the poor. Some might call it evil but to Yue it was simply pragmatic, if they actually installed equal conscription, not only would they lose a generation of future intellectuals and politicians, but they would also lose even more support, which the government did not have much of at the current time. The peasantry already had been riled up by the socialists in their own region, and the likelihood of a future uprising arising from the peasants under the watchful eye of the army was unlikely to say the least. Yue had made sure to make a few examples of people who refused the draft, and their corpses still littered the countryside as a grim reminder of what awaited those cowards and communists who would not fight and die for their country."

Sure it could defend a point, it could hit a target from cover, but it couldn't for the life of it's nation actually hold a place, huddle down, and defend it thoroughly. To actually achieve a defensive strategy of any calibre Lihuang would need two new organizations to meet the abilities of creation and overwatch of defensive points. First, the sapper corp was create to allow for the rapid and thorough entrenchment of divisions, alongside the ability to create permanent or semi-permanent structures in the field. The sapper corp could also create bridges, repair rail lines and telegram wires, and do any other sort of maintenance and service that would be needed by the army at that time. Secondly, the sentry corp was created to always have dedicated scouts and garrisons in every trench, making trench raids and surprise assaults plagued by difficulty if they would even try to reach Chinese lines. The sentry corp also functioned as a cavalry scout force, moving ahead of defensive positions to scout out new places for trenchworks behind enemy lines and to cause harassment attacks against the enemy. A large part of the creation of these two corps was a new tactic that Lihuang planned to employ, called "Deep Fortress", which entails the construction of quick to build trenches and small forts to be held until the first sign of casualties, then the unit would retreat to a new zone and create another fortress there instead. This constant grinding of the enemy would help to build on the pressure a war of attrition already brings, and through our unit's strong morale and good leadership we shall outlast the enemy, allowing us to easily conquer their lands with the grace of a swan, and with little of the bloodshed seen in other armies.

But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Lihuang was not about to let his chance at redemption fall through his fingers just because he didn't have the balls to be sneaky every so often, Seeing the success of Communist and Socialist Partisans had taught him much, one of those things being the fact that their success was undeniable. Even if Chiang refused to see reality, Lihuang saw opportunity to bring victory to his nation. The Nationalist Army would form a Guerrilla segment of itself, focused on the demolition and sabotage of important behind the lines elements, as well as ambushes and assassinations. All of what they would do is rather ghastly, but they had to do what they had to do in order to win against the bandit foes. The Guerrillas would be formed of existing sentry corp and sapper corp members who would volunteer for the risky missions, as they would be extremely dangerous as compared to their normal fare of building trenches and scouting new positions. Then they would go through a few weeks of training, and be placed behind enemy lines to wreck as much havoc as possible. Due to the virtual impossibility of communication, these Guerrilla units will be very autonomous in their function and training and will hopefully be able to recruit locals to grow their ranks until they eventually reach a good enough size to cause an even larger campaign of chaos. These Guerrillas can also be used as advance scouts, spies, and any other possible position that is needed of them in their place in the armed forces. Although it is shameful to resort to such things, Lihuang has confidence that the Guerrillas will be a great success."

roc.27.d:0 "One of the most ignored yet all important strategies to war is that of supplies and logistics. People often ignore the issue in favor of theorizing their perfect army, unaware of that fact that their supply lines would have collapsed the moment they even tried to march somewhere. Lihuang has realized this problem, he has identified it and he has researched it, and he has understood the solution. By keeping two supply lines running side by side, a constant trickle of equipment and supplies will almost always be available, as even if one is hit or delayed, the second will always come. By keeping the supply line strong the men themselves are kept strong by a constant supply of food and resources, no man shall starve or lack clothing, even if it might be the dead of winter. Through our lines we could hold out for as long as we need too, and the enemy could only look at us with want and contempt as we sit around the cozy fire with rice and meat, while they eat gristle and millet. Our soldiers are men, they shall be treated like men, and they shall live like men, even in the cold and wet trenches they shall prosper. A prospering man fights better then any other, for he is happy and is fighting to protect his righteous jolliness, for it is his right to do so. Lihuang has also begun to attempt to replace elements of the supply corp with trucks instead of horses to greater impact its efficiency, as well as nationalize select industry and food production to be used by the military to maintain strong supply lines that do not waver with the season. The reliability of the line is the most important thing in the end, as even if the food is not of the best quality then the fact it is always there will keep the men happy and strong, Lihuang knew from his days as a soldier that the one thing to kill morale more then anything else was a lack of food, and being forced to eat millet and grass is not especially appealing to anybody."

Look outside your window, the entire city is up in flames, children are crying for their parents, and the police are helping the rioters flip over government worker's cars. You know that child wouldn't be crying for their parents normally, but sadly their parents are in a fucking factory starving because they have no lunch break, and are are getting paid less and less, all because of you mister President. I am sorry to say this so bluntly, but this entire horrific situation is entirely your fault for being such a stupid fucking moron, and I am resigning my post right here and now.

Chiang's minister of industry barged out of the president's room in his ad hoc Presidential palace, spitting on the floor and spouting a variety of slurs and insults towards Chiang as he left the government building most likely for the last time. As he had been screamed at, Chiang had only stood, his jaw ajar, unable to protest but merely accepting the lecture that he had earned. The minister hadn't been lying, the city was indeed on fire, and Chiang could hear gunshots and screams from the outside despite the palace's walled and elevated position within the city.

Some men would walk around in perfect green uniforms with imported British and German webbing and helmets, alongside high quality Gewehr 98s and Mosin Nagants. Most men, however, walked in raggedy uniforms of randoms colors from blue to black to yellow to tan, and instead of helmets had to make do with simple cloth caps. Often these soldiers do not have a rifle at all, but instead only have a pistol, or in extreme cases, a handmade Musket or a Qing era Matchlock. If China is to be seen as any other nation as a respectable force, it cannot walk around in colorful rags! This must first start with the standardization of the uniform, which shall be a light green as to match much of the landscape of China. No leeway shall be given in respect to regional climate or terrain, production must be optimized as much as possible and a few extra causalities is worth having everyone clothed. Second, the standard headgear shall consist of a copy of the German Stahlhelm, of course made of cheaper material and as thin as possible, but this is the price that is payed for everyone getting one. Thirdly, the standard rifle shall be the Hanyang copy of the Mauser 88, converted to fire modern 7.92 Mauser of Chinese production, we shall not be reliant on external imports to supply our army. Lastly, a standard pistol shall be issued called the Tsao-99, which is in no way related to the Mauser C96 handgun and does not break any international copyright laws. Through this standardization of equipment our divisions will be streamlined in look and in function, with consistent quality of troops no matter their regional origin or their officer's position within the nationalist government.

Still, unlike the Dare to Die corps, the Assault corp are made up of conscripts and convicts, not volunteers, and they are armed with pistols and shotguns instead of Grenades and Swords. So they are clearly superior and not at all or in any way completely reprehensible. The assault corp will function as another element of Yue's doctrine of "The Human Sea" where men are send out in massive waves with strong points, being either armor or assault troops, to pierce through enemy lines and engulf them in a sea of blood and fire. It may be a very costly tactic, but it is very time effective, and time is something that the nationalists to do have an ideal amount of. Every day the rebels of China remain, every day the Nationalists are weakened more and more. As much as they would like to lie and say they have plenty of time Yue knows that if the civil war drags on for too long, the nation will collapse into a complete Disaster. To further avoid this Yue has managed to purchase a contract for American surplus artillery, from one of their little petty warlord states that likes to call themself a country. Hopefully these new batteries will be able to further support the waves with a rolling bombardment, allowing a safe approach for the infantry involved, of course until they get to the enemy themselves.
