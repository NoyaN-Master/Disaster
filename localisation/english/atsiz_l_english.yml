 #events
 atsiz.10.t:0 "The Nzdeh Uprising"
 atsiz.10.d:0 "Today, the filthy Armenians have risen up against our rule. What originally started out as a series of small uprisings here and there has finally turned into a full on rebellion against our state. The Armenians, led by Garegin Nzhdeh, have proclaimed that they will "put an end to the oppression of their people and to Turkish tyranny". Of course, their rule shall be short lived and we will conquer them and bring them back into the fold in no time."
 atsiz.10.a:0 "CHARGE!"

 atsiz.1.t:0 "The New Order"
 atsiz.1.d:0 "Our great leader has begun to ensure that his rule shall remain unquestioned in all of Turkey, with one of his first actions in ensuring so being the banning of every political party within the nation, and in their place installing his own political movement, led by his loyalists and most trusted associates, who will be sure to bring Turkey up, where the former political parties had brought it down."
 atsiz.1.a:0 "Nation and Power."

 atsiz.2.t:0 "The Conquerers of The East"
 atsiz.2.d:0 "The Russians, oh the Russians. They constantly go on and on, droning about how they're Slavs, but in reality, we know the truth. The Russians are actually Turks and their Slavic identity is just another subset of the Turkic identity. They share the same origin as us, in the Central Asian steppe, and because of that they are our fellow brothers. We we shall make them see that, whether it is by means of peace or by force."
 atsiz.2.a:0 "Onwards!"

 atsiz.3.t:0 "The Conquerers of The West"
 atsiz.3.d:0 "In the heartland of Europe, away from Asia, lie yet another group of Turks, the Germanics. They have been fooled into believing that they are unrelated to us, when in reality they are as Turkic as can be. The Huns, as well as all the other ancient Germanic tribes were all originally tribes of Turks, who conquered their way into Europe. Whether or not the modern day descendants of the Germanics see things our way doesn't matter, because you cannot change the truth, and the truth is that they are Turks."
 atsiz.3.a:0 "Onwards!"

 atsiz.4.t:0 "The Subutais"
 atsiz.4.d:0 "To secure the reign of The New Order, we will create a militant organization called the Subutais and later on will integrate them into the re-organized army."
 atsiz.4.a:0 "Onwards!" 

 atsiz.6.t:0 "Armenian Discontent"
 atsiz.6.d:0 "It has came to our attention that the Armenian villages of the east are protesting our supposed Occupation and want withdrawal. Of course these protests were burned and destroyed, but we must be on foot to counter and insurrection."
 atsiz.6.a:0 "Worrying.."

 atsiz.7.t:0 "Battle of Yerevan"
 atsiz.7.d:0 "Our militants in Yerevan were harrased by the supposed Mountain Brigades but our soldiers have won even with high casulties. We will continue following the trails of the Armenians."
 atsiz.7.a:0 "Good."

 atsiz.11.t:0 "The Visit"
 atsiz.11.d:0 "It was a long and difficult journey through Tibet, but in the end Atsiz finally arrived at the monastery, hidden deep within the Tibetan mountains. There, he met up and talked with the monks, and after what seemed to be hours, they offered him to drink from one of their sacred brews, which he accepted. At first it didn't seem to do much, but after a while Atsiz found himself falling into a deep sleep. During his dream, the Gods took him to many strange and mythical places, each stranger than the last, and each greater and more beautiful. The Gods told him that he was the chosen one, the one that will bring order and balance to the degenerated and exploited world. To the gods, The Earth's surface was just for petty humans, the servant of the gods, to live for. Underneath the oceans and the ice there lived a great civilization of gods and warriors called Agartha. Atsiz was shook and asked where they were. The octopus-looking god answered.\n 'Shangri-La.'\n\n\nAfter he woke up, he didn't know what to make of his vision at first, but then he realized what the Gods were trying to tell him. Those great lands that he saw were what his nation was going to become. A great and mighty land, where all Turks would live in prosperity, and he was going to make it so, by any means necessary."
 atsiz.11.a:0 "This will change humanity."
 
 atsiz.12.t:0 "Uniting Eurasia, The Horde"
 atsiz.12.d:0 "While Church bells ringed all over the continent of the old, in the quarters of Istanbul, Atsiz sat in his office, talking to himself like a madman he was. But now, his mumbling was something as of importance, not only to his loyal people, but to the entire world. In the afternoon, for once in awhile, he finally went out to make a speech to his people, not only about the state of the country, but what great achievements it shall achieve. Large swaths of people gathered around the Dolmabahçe palace, which not only was once the seat of the now defunct and forgotten Ottoman Empire, but the residence of the Great Poet-Warrior. Atsiz stood proudly and without hesitation he proclaimed that the European continent has become a degenerate hellhole, where it's decline began after they adapted the teachings of nothing more than a power hungry Jew. And now to rid it from it's degeneracy he called for the unification of Eurasia against the Cypto-Jewish menace, mobilising his armies all around from the grand steppe to the streets of Damascus, the Sky God's prophet will not fail."
 atsiz.12.a:0 "We will prevail."

 atsiz.13.t:0 "The God of all Turks, finally awoken"
 atsiz.13.d:0 "At the Central Military Headquarters located in the Capital Of Avam Yönetimi, last touchs are being made for the largest military operation to be ever conducted in the history of Turkic people or even the mankind. This operation is codenamed as “The End Of The Roads” which is a reference to the poem that Adsız wrote in his service at the kemalist army. This Operations Goal is simple: Bringing the entirety of Europe under our iron grasp and the hundreds of years of struggle between the Turks and the Aryans. Unfortuanetly This operation is risky and with a scenario of  defeat would result with an end of the Turkic nation physically but also as an ideal. But the time has come And with Gods demand being our motive and our battle hardened soldiers being excited, we ll end these degenerate Europeans and become the Gods shadow on the earth!"
 atsiz.13.a:0 "Onwards!"
