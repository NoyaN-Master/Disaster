PRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the aftermath of the Great War, Germany laid in ruins, broken apart. The Junkers have taken power in Prussia, but they’re far from unopposed. Political dissidence is rampant in Prussia, and Junker rule is dwindling in power. The stage is set for a political catastrophe, and the sociopolitical struggles of this newly reborn country have Europe waiting with baited breath for what may come next."

preo.3.t:0 "Finalization of the Polish German Borders"
preo.3.d:0 "Since the establishment of Germany in 1871, poles in the eastern territories (mostly around Posen) were viewed as a week point to violate the German territorial integrity. Even though the local polish populace stayed somewhat loyal to the state, they were still a week point that any future Polish government may wish to strike upon as there was an overlapping interest for both parties. But after the Reich's successful conquest of it's former adversary in the east, that unsolved question can finally be concluded. Germans after traumatic events of collapse, disunification, civil war and foreign annexations of their fatherland; Decided to solve the issue through a totalist approach which would oversee the removal of entire polish communities out of it's territories. In 1871, Germans would have wished to do such thing but wouldn't achieve any success as the Russians would oppose to the idea. But now is a different time. As the Germans achieved real control over the Polish territories, they can now fulfil their nationalistic desires without any opposition. The exact plan for the Reich was to collaborate with it's governor's domain to issue a full exchange of communities. As the Germans deported all the poles they could get their hand on to their polish trashcan territories, germans living on the otherside were resettled to now empty deported territories in the Reich, solving the question of the century. The plan also included a proper finalisation of borders according to the Reich's desires."

preo.4.t:0 "Hans Frank in Occupied Poland"
preo.4.d:0 "Hans Frank, the Governer put in charge of overseeing the former adversary of the Reich (who also later on claimed to be the King of that domain) was in Wawel Castle. A historical castle of Prussian Heritage was now a symbol of the Prussian's return to east. In charge of the newly established Generalgouvernment, Hans Frank was a man of Patriotic duty. Actively checking the establishment of power around the Goralenvolk and other Germans in the area to speed up the Germanisation of his domain. As time passed and Hans turned his domain more into an extension of the former "German Reich", there began a saying among the German populace about the former polish domain becoming the France (Frankreich) in the east as a way of joking with the fact that Hans Frank turned Poland into his own kingdom "Frankreich" (Frank's Kingdom). So became the name of "Frankreich im Osten" as a joke name for Poland. The rising popularity of this trend eventually reached the ears of Hans Frank himself. In one occasion, a former nobleman with German decent had told him about France in the East is being far better than the France in the West. It's known that Hans Frank himself replied with the phrase "At least there is still a Frank in the East.", at least Hans had a sense of humour. "

preo.5.t:0 "Fate of the Generaalgouvernment"
preo.5.d:0 "What was once thought to be impossible is now the reality. After our glorious victory over the east, we didn't just keep them as our petty little servants but instead fully Germanised many of it's parts. Now is the time to divide what's left of our Generalgouvernment into two smaller parts to Germanise the rest. As the once polish parts of our territories are fully Germanised and integrated, we can now seperate the Belarusian and Ukrainian parts to focus on them as well. To also undermine the Russian opportunists in the east, we'll simply call our new puppet states as "Free" states as if they are actually independent countries themselves. Though, the reality will be far from it."
preo.5.a:0 "Alright"

preo.6.t:0 "Fate of Austria"
preo.6.d:0 "Austria had her fate completely intertwined with the German state since it's very founding, after all, their beginnings were nothing more then a simple vassal created inside the First Reich to protect people of southern Germany from Magyar raids. This seemingly irrelevant state has then rose to a position of power from which, for a moment, they even led the German people and their many nations under a single Roman banner. Tragically as time dragged on Austria was culturally more and more separated from the core of Germany, the rise of Prussia and eventual unification of kleindeutschland has completely destroyed any links that tied Austria to our nation. We will most likely never erase the stains of separation and no matter how hard we try Austria may remain a separate entity forever, what we can do is bring Austria back to its rightful position, as a little brother state of Germany. The new customs union we established has abolished any economic barriers between our nations sharply increasing the economic growth of both, this is due to the fact that Austria's underdeveloped economy now has a massive industrial base from which they can supply their needs, the German base, and our nation benefitted greatly too as hundreds of factions and tens of industrial companies across Germany now have a new unexploited market to the south. So far, the future seems bright for our cooperation, with time and continued economic development the Austrians will quickly adapt to their position of Germany's little brother."

preo.7.d:0 "While the core lands of Bohemia had long languished under the Austrian boot, they remained fastidiously independent of their erstwhile Germanic overlords, and intend to do so under our own Germanic rule. That ends now. With our Sudeten brothers brought back into the Reich's fold, we will now embark upon the quest of purifying the blood of Czechs themselves. It will not be an easy task, as the Czechs are a proud people, and yet more proud of their own culture, but it is a vital one. For all of their troublesome refusal to bow to their former Austrian overlords, they are an industrious people in a region blessed with seemingly endless deposits of coal and iron. If we have learned anything from the failure of our Austrian brothers, it is that Czechs do not respond well to direct attacks, stubborn as they are. All of the children of Bohemia shall be educated in German language alongside their own putrid tongue; if the German teachers happen to be better, who can blame us? If the Czech teachers are shuffled and fired at random, we blame educational issues. If buildings and monuments important to "Czech history" are torn down for new ones, it really is the fault of the local governments that failed to respond to notices written in the perfect German tongue. The Czechs may be frustrated by this, but it is not until their grandchildren can no longer speak to them that they shall understand the fullness of our conquest. What is a Czech, if their forefathers cannot tell them? A future German."

These terrible crimes will be reversed he shouted. Von Goltz has organised a plan where Baltic Germans will be transferred back into their cities, homes and business and, in order to accommodate for such, Estonian and Latvian people will have a taste of their own medicine and will be sent out to a foreign land, as our people had to endure."

preo.10.t:0 "The Volksliste "
preo.10.d:0 "The task of Germanizing our newly conquered regions in Poland has been very difficult, but a new proposal brought to us by a newly instituted Gauleiter, Hans Frank, has interested us. He specifically cites that a number of nominally Polish children have Germanic traits, especially in areas associated with the Ostsiedlung of old. Unfortunately, however, he does recommend against attempting to Germanize the whole families. While the children do show signs of racial vigor, the parents are too far corrupted by the Polish "culture" to be saved; indeed, not even a portion of Germanic blood can undo such taint. He therefore recommends a project to rescue these children from their "culture", taking them from their parents and placing them with good German families, especially those which are past child-bearing age, to protect valuable blood from the taint that their unfortunate parents were victim too."

However, the realities of the constitution, which still maintains a shaky artifice of democracy, have forced the army's power to be kept informal, represented more by backroom deals and political loopholes than open political methods.

pre.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of the collapse of the Paris Peace Conference and the French occupation of the west bank of the Rhine, the failure to defend the Rhineland from an invasion that blatantly violated the Armistice was the last nail in the coffin for the already impoverished and chaotic republic, and Ebert didn't bother resisting when reactionary Junkers, with the backing of the Army and Freikorps, marched into Berlin, creating a new regime under the rightist bureaucrat Wolfgang Kapp. However, the putschists were hated by much of the population and lacked the resources to consolidate power across the country, and leftist uprisings broke out in much of Germany, cutting off the main Putschist forces in Prussia. In spite of this, separate Bavarian Freikorps units under Franz Ritter von Epp and Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, among others, were able to restore a reactionary government under the conservative Gustav Kahr, and this regime proceeded to aid rightists in the neighboring states of Baden and Wurtemberg restore their own monarchies. Although the Prussian regime celebrated this, hoping that the rightists in Southern Germany would reunite with them, Kahr, a strong regionalist, proclaimed an independent Bavarian state instead, while the socialists managed to secure their grip over the north-west, and local Freikorps units in Mecklenburg and Saxony also asserted their independence, and the Danes occupied the Kiel canal.\nLeft with only Prussia, a broken Kapp was forced to resign by the very same aristocrats and officers who had put him in power a matter of months. Since then, the subsequently proclaimed Prussian republic has seen its politics dominated by the Junkers and their allies, with many accusing the state of operating a mere sham democracy, with a succession of Chancellors all answering to and working with the same aristocratic cliques. However, the current Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, is known to be more blatantly authoritarian, militaristic, and pro-worker than the Junkers, alongside his reputation for political intrigues. In opposition to the Junker government are the reformists of the Nationale Liberale Partei, which was re-established by Prussian liberals after initially falling apart after the collapse of the German Empire. Despite their staunch support for democracy, they also take a determined Pan-Germanist stance, dreaming of the day when all Germans are united under one flag. Meanwhile, the Junkers' failure to either restore the Hohenzollern monarchy or make any effective moves to restore German pride has galvanized opposition on the right as well. Both Alfred Hugenberg's reactionary monarchist DNVP and the Alldeutsch Nationale Partei, formed by Herman von Goring after Kahr had him exiled from Bavaria for his pan-Germanism and extremism, are harsh critics of the status quo."

Initially a member of the DNVP, he broke with the party over Hugenberg's radicalism, making him a trustworthy candidate in the eyes of the Junkers.\n However, Schleicher has been planning for some time to make his own move at consolidating power, forming a so-called "Querfront" coalition of nationalist and pro-worker parties to oppose Goring and also free himself of Junker control, and also bypass the Junkers' power.

With the Chancellory surrounded, Schleicher himself surrendered 2 hours later, and was quietly taken to a secure prison, where he shall await trial for treason while his allies are unceremoniously disposed of.\nNow, Herman von Goring finds himself at last in control of Prussia, but his grip is nevertheless a fragile one, with the Junkers' influence strong as ever within the unity government. As such, we are now facing calls from the military and moderates in the Party to try to continue working with the Junkers, in the hope of better uniting the nation.

This came to a head today, when Oskar von Hindenburg announced to the Reichstag, seemingly without even consulting Goring, that the unity government had come to an end, and that Goring's term in office was over. With the Chancellery sounded by pro-Junker soldiers for the second time recently, Goring had little choice but to submit, and forlornly confirmed his resignation.

Nonetheless, the speech was broadly well received, drawing reluctant applause even from the hardline nationalist and reformist liberals present, and praised by the press. Surely, if there's one thing we can count on, it's a stable political scene."
pre.18.a:0 "Very well"
pre.19.t:0 "Attacking the AdNP"
pre.19.d:0 "For years, Prussia's various governments have, behind the facade of democracy, employed a significant amount of manipulation and intimidation to keep the opposition firmly out of power, and now is no different. With Herman Goring's Alldeutsche Nationale Partei rapidly gaining traction among disillusioned nationalists and young army officers, Schleicher's allies in the Abwehr have come to us with a new proposal to undermine these dangerous extremists.\nThe National Bolshevik theorist Ernst Niekisch played a crucial role in the founding of the party, seeing the Prussian ethos of the more conventional nationalist Goring as a shift in the right direction towards a nationalist and socialist Germany. Predictably, his left wing of the party has come into much conflict with the party's aristocratic and corporatist mainstream. As such, the Abwehr is suggesting that we meet in secret with Niekisch's allies, to sow greater dissatisfaction with Goring among the AdNP's left wing. Nonetheless, many Junkers are concerned that in strengthening Niekisch we may simply create another powerful opposition movement that will cause problems for us later on."
pre.19.a:0 "It's not worth the effort"
pre.19.b:0 "Go ahead"
pre.20.t:0 "The Report Leaks"
pre.20.d:0 "Today, our worst fears have come to pass. The corruption report, in all its horrendous detail, was published on the front page of Die Gartenlaube, Alfred Hugenberg's flagship newspaper. The country has already been thrown into chaos, with the opposition, whether royalist, nationalist, or liberal, all pouring out into the streets, demanding not just Schleicher's resignation but the outright end of Junker rule in Prussia. Goring's blue-shirt paramilitaries and liberal deputies alike are now baying for our blood. Although we may never know who leaked the report, it is safe to say that that man has done more damage to our government than any other since 1919. While we scramble to find a response to the chaos, one thing is certain: Prussia will never be the same again"
pre.20.a:0 "How did we let this happen?"
pre.21.t:0 "The Goring Putsch"
pre.21.d:0 "Today, with the Querfront talks having collapsed, and Niekisch's now humiliated left-AdNP having turned back in humiliation to Goring, Schleicher finally fell. Military units, working in close co-ordination with Goring's blue-shirts, seized vital administrative and media buildings across Berlin, while outside of the capital local garrisons and blue-shirt groupings were able to assume control of the local administrations.\nAt 1PM, the Reichstag almost unanimously passed a hastily prepared bill granting "supreme and unrestrained power" to Herman Goring, as Prussia's sole and unchallenged leader. The few deputies that had voted against this bill were promptly rounded up by the soldiers who had forced their way into the chamber, and have since been charged with high treason.\nTwo hours later, with the Chancellery surrounded and all hope lost, Schleicher finally surrendered, and was led out of the building by a tightly-knit group of soldiers, while hundreds of blue-shirts gathered in the street chaotically demanded his execution on the spot. Although the military men's professionalism won out, and the lynch mob achieved little, his days are doubtless numbered.\nNow, however, Goring alone stands at the helm of the Prussian nation, and God alone knows what lies next..."
pre.21.a:0 "Heil Goring!"
pre.22.t:0 "The Talks Begin"
pre.22.d:0 "Today in Berlin, Kurt von Schleicher formally opened talks between a number of different political groups to form a new Querfront coalition against the Junkers and fanatic nationalists. Present at the negotiations were the National-Bolshevik philosopher Ernst Niekisch, who, despite having co-founded the AdNP with Goring, has become increasingly estranged from the party's mainstream, the social democrat Otto Braun, who was able to rally the remnants of Prussia's SPD in the 1920s and rebuild its political machine after the rightist putsch of 1919, and representatives of many smaller nationalist organizations which have become increasingly estranged from Goring, most notably Franz Seldte's Stalhelm veterans' group and paramilitary.\nIt can't be denied that the coalition Schleicher is trying to build is an extraordinarily big tent, but the Chancellor is nonetheless hopeful. After all, there is no other way he could hold on to power."
pre.22.a:0 "We'll need a lot of luck to pull this off..."
pre.23.t:0 "The Enabling Act is Passed"
pre.23.d:0 "Today in the Reichstag, a body already informally stripped of much of its power through extensive arrests and intimidation, Goring's extreme amounts of power were further formalized. The prominent Reichstag deputy and leader of Goring's blue-shirts, Hosrt Wessel, introduced a new motion - the Enabling Act. This law, adopted all but unanimously a short time later, gives Goring overwhelming executive power to alter the constitution and stamp out opposition groups at will. From now on, the law of Prussia is Goring's will. Nothing more, and nothing less."
pre.23.a:0 "Heil Goring!"
pre.24.t:0 "The Restoration of the Kingdom of Prussia"
pre.24.d:0 "Today, at a vast rally in Konigsberg, Hermann Goring made a sudden and unprecedented announcement. The Kingdom of Prussia, having collapsed in 1918 with Wilhelm II's abdication, was to be restored effective-immediately, with Goring declared its Regent. Notably present at the rally was August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern, a younger son of the old Kaiser and a longstanding supporter of the AdNP. Given his increasingly close relationship with the Goring government, many are now starting to believe that "little Auwi", as he has been mockingly dubbed by the press, may in fact become King."
pre.24.a:0 "Heil Goring!"
pre.25.t:0 "The Coronation"
pre.25.d:0 "Today, in a lavish ceremony in Berlin, August Wilhelm von Hohenzollern was crowned as King of Prussia. With the historic Hohenzollern crown placed upon his head by the Lutheran bishop in front of a vast audience, and Goring as his chancellor only a short distance away, it was clear to all that the old Kingdom had indeed been restored, but under a very different government to that which had ruled the Empire prior to 1918 - and, indeed, one that isn't going anywhere. Nonetheless, the historic coronation has generated widespread enthusiasm, and has done much to legitimize Goring's rule."
pre.25.a:0 "A glorious day!"
pre.26.t:0 "Nationwide Pogroms"
pre.26.d:0 "Across the country, patriotic citizens, spurred on by local units of blueshirts and by the rhetoric of Goring and his propagandist Hans Fritzsche, are taking action like never before against Jewish influence. Over the past days, Jewish-owned shops and businesses have been attacked, looted, or even outright repossessed by the mobs, and many Jewish citizens have been attacked in the street. This violence is earning us much condemnation around the world, something hardly helped by our continued endorsement of both the ideals and methods of the  mobs, but it is nonetheless needed in order to free Prussia from the shackles of Jewish influence and global finance."
pre.26.a:0 "If only people stood up for themselves like this more often..."
pre.27.t:0 "Changes at the Abwehr"
pre.27.d:0 "Over the past days, notable changes have been underway at the national intelligence agency, the Abwehr, something that has hardly gone unnoticed by the public. The agency's old guard, dominated by such figures as Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which gained its influence under Junker rule and was closely aligned with the Schleicher government, has been purged almost in its entirety, with hundreds of officials unceremoniously removed from office. Their replacements, mainly old blue-shirt officers, have been tirelessly combing through file after file, gathering prodigious levels of intelligence for the new government. Few are certain what exactly this turn of events signifies, but it's clear that something big is around the corner..."
pre.27.a:0 "Just you wait and see..."
pre.28.t:0 "The Night of the Long Knives"
pre.28.d:0 "As the Prussian nation woke up this morning, they were confronted with an astonishing reality, far beyond anything that even the most pessimistic anti-nationalists could have dreamed of. Hundreds of opponents of the regime, from socialists to reactionary aristocrats, were murdered last night in one fell sweep. Ernst Niekisch, the National-Bolshevik co-founder of the AdNP, who increasingly diverged from Goring, was riddled with bullets in the middle of the street. Otto Braun, leader of the Prussian SPD, was hung in his own home. Wilhelm Kulz, the veteran centrist, was found mutilated in a ditch outside Berlin. Hundreds more met similar fates, and from now on nobody will so much as dare to speak a bad word about the Chancellor or King. Goring's rule was always absolute, but from this point onwards it will be unchallenged entirely. Only a bloodbath such as this could have liberated the nation."
pre.28.a:0 "You get what you fucking deserve!"
pre.29.t:0 "A Meeting with Oster"
pre.29.d:0 "Although Schleicher has managed to consolidate his power in the short term, with the aid of Braun and Niekisch among others, much work still needs to be done for the political situation to be stabilized: a task for which we'll need a great many allies. With this in mind, Chancellor von Schleicher today met with the Abwehr administrator Hans Oster, a longstanding supporter of many of Schleicher's ideas, and opponent of Goring. Although what exactly the two discussed will likely remain unclear forever, it is clear that from here on out the Abwehr, already a vital ally of Schleicher, will play a crucial role in his government, and that it may begin to put its vast resources towards aiding him in what remains of his consolidation of power."
pre.29.a:0 "Excellent!"
pre.30.t:0 "Preparing for the Speech"
pre.30.d:0 "Kurt von Schleicher is now preparing to address the Reichstag for the second time in recent months, but so much has changed since his last speech. The Junkers have fallen from grace spectacularly, and Schleicher himself has gone from little more than their puppet to an increasingly powerful military dictator, backed by everyone from social democrats to National Bolsheviks. However, the broad range of groups that support the Schleicher government is increasingly confusing to much of the public, and many of Schleicher's aides are suggesting that, in his forthcoming speech, he should seek to clarify the principles and ideological stance of the Querfront government.\nThe problem with this, however, is that it is hard to say what that is. As such, different prominent figures in the Querfront have come forward with very different proposals. The National-Bolshevik Ernst Niekisch is urging Schleicher to declare the new state to be "in principle and reality both socialist, and socialist, for such is the ethos of the eternal Prussian nation". On the other hand, the veteran social democrat Otto Braun is calling on Schleicher to state that "although democracy has always been at the heart of our republic, that democracy can for the time being no longer persist, if the state can have the strength to truly help its people". More conventional nationalists under Franz Seldte, on the other hand, want Schleicher to announce that "the state of Prussia will always be a conservative one, and our reforms are vital if anything is to be conserved at all".\nThe three different suggestions give radically different impressions of the nature of Schleicher's government, but it is clear that we'll have to side with one of them, if we are to bring some clarity to the purpose of our regime."
pre.30.a:0 "Niekisch makes the strongest point"
pre.30.b:0 "Braun's suggestions are best"
pre.30.c:0 "Side with Seldte on this one"
pre.31.t:0 "The DNVP and the Querfront"
pre.31.d:0 "Although Alfred Hugenberg's DNVP has not been invited to the Querfront talks, a great deal of activity has been taking place at their central offices over the last few days. It is clear that, although not everything about the coalition fills Hugenberg with enthusiasm, he may be coming to view it as preferable to the rule of Goring, or a revived Junker government. The inclusion of his paramilitary allies, the Stalhelm, in the talks has likely also gone some way to making the Querfront attractive to him. However, Hugenberg knows that Schleicher's position is still anything but secure, and is hesitant to become too committed, lest the tide turn yet again. For now, it seems, he intends to watch and wait, and see where the future leads."
pre.31.a:0 "Interesting"
pre.32.t:0 "The DNVP joins the Querfront"
pre.32.d:0 "With Schleicher having stabilized his government, and now rapidly consolidating his power, Alfred Hugenberg, leader of the DNVP, has reached a clear conclusion. His party's future, he has decided, is much better served within the new government than outside it, where it would likely be outlawed and crushed. As such, he has agreed with Kurt von Schleicher, with Franz Seldte mediating between the two, that the DNVP will be incorporated into the Querfront coalition, and will from now on support the Schleicher government."
pre.32.a:0 "Excellent!"
pre.33.t:0 "A Rainy Night in Konigsberg"
pre.33.d:0 "Hermann Goring trudged along through the wet street, his soaked overcoat shielding the blue uniform beneath. The old airman was tired, and stressed: Schleicher was only getting more powerful, and by now Goring had to watch his back. But he walked on, for there was vital business to be done.\nDuring the earlier days of the crisis, countless coups against Schleicher had been discussed and planned, only to be called off later on. This time, however, would be different. Countless extremely influential businessmen, aristocrats, generals, had all been pushed over the line by the madness and radicalism of the Schleicher regime. They knew that drastic action had to be taken to liberate Prussia from this traitorous cyptosocialist, and they knew that Goring was the man for the job.\nGoring reached the building - an impressive one, surely a good sign of the power of the people who had reached out to him. He made his way in, and was greeted with obvious enthusiasm by a neatly-uniformed doorman, who relieved him of his coat and led him onwards to an impressive door, behind which, of course, would be the men who had approached him. Goring walked forwards, turned the handle, and made his way in.\nBut there was only one man in that room. One man, pointing a gleaming pistol right ahead."
pre.33.a:0 "So long, Hermann"
pre.34.t:0"Guns before Math"
pre.34.d:0"'And what do we do when an officer of superior rank approaches us?' The classroom of 8 year olds stared back up at the massive and imposing man, his silver moustache flickering in indignation at even the slightest hesitation on the part of the students, 'We salute, you moronic brats, how many times must I tell you this for it to get through your thick skull!?'. One of the children at the back began to snuffle, and then like a rushing river his tears came flowing, clearly he was not used to being screamed at by the strange man who had replaced their kind Math teacher as part of a new government initiative. 'All of you are failures, and if you were serving I would have every one of you shot on the damn spot! But sadly I have to teach you brats to be soldiers, so you better harden up or you'll find yourself on your ass begging for marks!' By this point the entire class was crying, screaming at children is generally not conducive to a healthy educational experience, but teaching children basic skills or mathematics or how to read has fallen below teaching children proper military etiquette. Despite what these children desperately wish was true, they will never see their kindly old teacher again, instead they are primed for months of screaming and beatings to try and shape them up."
pre.34.a:0"Ahhh, traditional education once again!"
pre.35.t:0"'Tactical' Split"
pre.35.d:0"Now normally a nobleman can't tell the difference between a rifle grenade and a suppository, but the Junkers, under new and slightly more competent political leadership, have managed to leverage their own stupidity to their advantage. The Monarchists and the Fascists felt so safe in their little coalition, after all they had they Junker money machine pumping out funding to make sure no opposition could ever truly exist, but they forgot about those very Junkers having any sense of competency. Now of course it started as an accident, one Junker, a poor lad with dual personality disorder, had one of his personalities support the monarchists, and the other support the fascists. Each side said it would sent an envelope of money for whichever new rally, but switched up the letters so the one addressed to the fascists went one way, and one addressed to the monarchists went to the other. Each side claimed the other had stolen their money, and as neither side was willing to give up the money they had to the other in case the other was bluffing, the situation escalated. Eventually both sides simply decided that the political situation which they found themselves in was one that could not be dug out of, and the grand coalition was dissolved in a matter of days. Now the Junkers control both parties from the shadows, and manage all the wealth and power in the nation, all thanks to one inbred noblemen who switched up the mail."
pre.35.a:0"Ah the folly of Nobility!"
pre.36.t:0"Proper Allocation of Funds"
pre.36.d:0"Under the new government, a program of rural investment has been deemed the best path forwards by the entirely unbiased council of state. Of course this just happens to involve roughly 90% of the budget of the program being invested in the various Junker landlord holdings across the countryside, which due to our refused to enact land reform remain the majority ownership of land in the country. There have been many complaints in regard to this, with various activists, farmers, and other crypto-communists trying to destroy our blessed fatherland by freeing land ownership. This is simply communist propaganda however, as anything other then our glorious and not at all corrupt Junker class owning land is clearly a form of socialism in the making! It only so happens that all of our policies help them, because what is good for them is good for the country! These cries of 'unsustainability' and 'human rights' are from people with no understanding of our glorious fatherland nor its economic system, everything is working perfectly, and there is absolutely no corruption within the country whatsoever."
pre.36.a:0"DAmn right"
pre.37.t:0"An Army's Economics"
pre.37.d:0"Now austerity and a war economy may on the surface seem like two incompatible things, after all austerity is the reduction of spending and the privatization of businesses and industry to eliminate state debt, while a war economy is a form of economics where the market is completely or mostly controlled by the state towards the direction of military and essential production, as well as the mass nationalization of industry. However this results from an underestimation of the German spirit, for we can form a war economy based on the reduction of spending on all other areas except that of warfare. We shall organize the economy around the functions of the state and military through dirgisme, but also cut all welfare and social spending programs to ensure that we have the funds for absolute military power. Now this will probably enrage and dishearten the country's poor, but the best social welfare program is the military after all!"
pre.37.a:0"Truly a Master of Economics"
pre.38.t:0"The Grain of Wrath"
pre.38.d:0"The current government is aware of the issue of the countryside, it is plain as day to see the problem. The Junker landlords own almost all the productive land within Prussia, and they don't use it for jack shit. The rural areas of our country are barren and undeveloped, contributing practically nothing to our economy or our nation. So in reasoning response we pushed forward a law to enact sweeping land reform, replacing the feudal landlords with normal privately owned farms and co-ops. This has been met with extreme push back from the Junker class, who see our efforts as that of 'Republicans' and 'Communists', and how somehow private farming is the path to socialism. These people have never been known for their intellect, but their political power and influence is still dangerous, and their hardline opposition to any efforts in respect to reform have made our job a living hell. Due to their influence in the military, we have been relying on specific sympathetic officers and police rather then the entirety of our forces to enforce the law, and even then, our enforcement is limited at best. We have managed some success in the less wealthy regions, but the majority of our land remains unused and in decay under the rotting hand of the nobility. The farmers cry out for help, but unless we do something drastic, our efforts will remain partial and ineffective."
pre.38.a:0"Why even own land if you don't use it?"
pre.39.t:0"The Army's Status"
pre.39.d:0"Within the Prussian Army the political militias that initially made up our defence force have largely faded away, with a real disciplined army falling in its place. The doctrines and uniforms are both calls back to the aristocratic and imperial past, but it has so far managed to maintain itself despite the difficulties, although the question of if it could function in a proper war is still up to debate. Currently the Junkers hold far too much influence within the officer corp, which is an issue that will eventually have to be rectified if we don't want the continued formation of socialist sympathies within the army and reduced operational effectiveness. Our training regime is outdated by most countries standards, with the use of physical punishments such as beatings still common, but it isn't called Prussian discipline for nothing. Overall there are plenty of issues that need to be solved, and plenty of heads that need a few well placed bullets within them to allow for full operational ability."
pre.39.a:0"We need to improve!"
pre.40.t:0"Lightening War"
pre.40.d:0"What is the central point of modern warfare? Some say logistics, but one can sit on a pile of food and bullets as long as they want, eventually they shall fall. Some say firepower, but artillery does not conquer land. Some say the people, but the people are nothing but a means to an end. In reality the central point of modern warfare is maneuver, the ability to confidently conquer in a unrelenting offensive of steel shall bring us victory on the battlefield. The dogs of war surrounding the enemy and then consuming them through their superior speed and technology shall win the day, not quantity, but quality! This tactic shall ensure victory against the lesser men and degenerates that surround us, and the glory of Prussia shall once again be known across the entire world! Of course there is the fact that this form of tactics makes us heavily reliant on our supply lines, and our ability to cover those very supply lines will be severely hampered by the amount of troops and tanks that must be part of the spearhead which will bring us victory. Additionally, this tactic only proves effective when we have superior armor to the enemy, in cases where we do not, we are essentially fucked, but hey, nothing is perfect."
pre.40.a:0"Alright"
pre.41.t:0"State of Emergency"
pre.41.d:0"The position of democracy within the Prussian state has been questionable for quite a long time, in fact historically Prussia barely managed to even be considered a proper Constitutional Monarchy! Despite it all, the Liberal forces of the nation have managed to narrowly achieve power through the use of political fuckery and the exploitation of the incompetence of the other political factions of Prussia. However, the entirety of Prussia is against us, our stance for the modernization of the nation has been met with open hostility by many, and only our working class support has allowed us to maintain power to any reasonable degree. A few days ago, in the dark halls of the office of defence, dark plots had begun brewing, ones which would coup our young government and install the fascists, and would destroy any hope of a modern and democratic Germany! Although the support of Liberals in the army is iffy at best, the Reichstag managed to force through a bill which would see a state of emergency declared until the mutinous soldiers could be caught and found, and then disposed of. This would be done through the use of the police and other officials rather then the military itself, as they are those who are directly under investigation. Let us hope that this period of power does not have to last long, and we can return to normalcy soon."
pre.41.a:0"Let's fix Germany"
pre.42.t:0"Political Solidification"
pre.42.d:0"So far, the powers at be have been reliant on the use of executive orders through the head of government rather then a proper democratic system, with the Reichstag functioning as nothing more then political red tape to enshrine our decrees into law. If we truly wish to live in a modern Germany, this must be rectified, as our current path is only that of dictatorship and political repression. We shall make the Reichstag the sole originator of political power, with all law and governance having to be approved by it, as well as improve the pay and political power of individual Reichstag representatives. Additionally, we shall ban the guaranteed military and Junker seats that have so bit us in the ass at every opportunity, replacing them with normal elected representatives. We shall also expand the number of representatives to various regions which have had no representation, and reorganize the province system to provide a more uniform amount of citizens per representative. Hopefully this will increase our majority in parliament and solidify our power so that any opposition cannot reasonably form against democracy, some may say that these methods are leading us to a single party state, but we tell them that is simply the cost of democracy. After all, if they actually expanded political rights beyond their own liberal party, socialists and communists might gain influence in the country!"

 # war economy decisions 
PRE_war_economy_decision:0"Readying The War Economy"
PRE_war_economy_decision_desc:0"In order to make sure we fight a grand war as effectively and as well as we possibly can, we must make sure to take several decisions regarding production, rationing, the workforce, and anything else that could help the war economy and war production"
PRE_war_economy_decision_1:0"Start Rationing"
PRE_war_economy_decision_1_desc:0"In order to have an efficient war economy, we must start rationing food supply, in order to make sure our stocks do not run out and everything is carefully managed"
PRE_war_economy_decision_2:0"Introduce War Bonds"
PRE_war_economy_decision_2_desc:0"We need more funds to invest into the war effort, and we can easily get more by appealing to the public. They will happily aid their great state to fight any war we need to win."
PRE_war_economy_decision_3:0"Pressure the Rich"
PRE_war_economy_decision_3_desc:0"The rich are called rich for a reason, they have great deals of money, money that could be used in a war effort! By using political influence and threats, we can coerce them into giving us bonds we can use."
PRE_war_economy_decision_4:0"Increase Working Days"
PRE_war_economy_decision_4_desc:0"As unpopular this decision may be, it is needed! A few more working hours is a worthy price to pay to win a war, and thus it will be done."
PRE_war_economy_decision_5:0"Woman Workforce"
PRE_war_economy_decision_5_desc:0"Women in the workforce, and in the factories may be a bizarre and outright scandalous thing for many people, but with much of the original workforce off to fight in the army, it is imperative we take this act to maintain war production."

# navy and army loc
PRE_navy:0"Revive the Prussian Navy"
PRE_navy_desc:0"Centuries ago, our ancestors ignored naval forces and focused only on land forces. While our armies had many victories on land, they unfortunately suffered defeat after defeat at sea. It is necessary to learn from the mistakes of the past and build a navy that will make Prussia stronger."
PRE_submarine:0"U-boats"
PRE_submarine_desc:0"It would be very wrong to ignore the submarines that are today's technological marvels and terrorized the Atlantic during the Great War. Supporting the large and powerful warships we will produce with submarines will cause us to establish a very serious superiority over the enemy."
PRE_destroyer:0"Merchant Marine"
PRE_destroyer_desc:0"Small ships are so important as well as other ships. They move very fast and shoot very fast. They can mine the seas both stealthily and very quickly. It's not a bad idea to invest in small ships as well."
PRE_new_navy:0"Revived Prussian Navy"
PRE_new_navy_desc:0"Finally, the reforms are over. The Prussian navy is confidently ready to burn down and bury enemy ships in the sea."
PRE_navy_idea:0"Prussian Naval Reforms"
PRE_navy_idea_desc:0"Thanks to our efforts, the Prussian navy has become one of the strongest navies in Europe."
PRE_air:0"Dominate the Skies"
PRE_air_desc:0"We saw how effective the air force was in the Great War. Perhaps the air force can be of great use in our struggle over Germany."
PRE_bombers:0"New Bombers"
PRE_bombers_desc:0"Bombers are the best type of aircraft to burn down enemy cities and factories. The more modern and powerful bombers we produce, the more powerful blows we can strike enemy cities and factories."
PRE_fighter_air:0"Fighter Blueprints"
PRE_fighter_air_desc:0"Fighters decide the fate of air battles. The more modern and advanced they are, the more chances they have to decide the fate of air battles. So we need to make plans for new fighters to strengthen the Prussian air force."
PRE_air_reform:0"Study Air Doctrines"
PRE_air_reform_desc:0"After major reforms, all that remained was to establish doctrines for our air force."
