rom.1.t:0 "Background on Modern Romanian History"
rom.1.d:0 "Romania, a country barely 70 years old, has already been spat on by its neighbors multiple times over, most recently in the Balkan War. That disaster of a war resulted in the loss of Banat to the treacherous Serbs, who parade themselves around as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It also resulted in a military government formed with the blessing of King Ferdinand I, headed by Marshal Constantin Prezan. Due to this arrangement, once Ferdinand died in 1927, the generals strong-armed the succession to crown Ferdinand's grandson, Mihai, as king. Not only did this completely bypass his fater and Ferdinand's son, Carol II, but it also resulted in a regency due to Mihai only being about 6 years old at the time of his grandfather's death. This didn't seem to bother Carol all that much however, and he's currently living the high life in France with his mistress. Now that there is no real political opposition left to stop them, the marshals have started an extensive rearmament campaign in order to retake Banat from the crumbling Serb conglomerate. With Prezan proclaiming that he will step down once the reclamation is complete, this has led to a power struggle within the military, primarily between Marshal Ion Antonescu, who wishes to maintain military rule indefinitely, and Marshal Averescu, who seeks to return to a democratic form of government."
