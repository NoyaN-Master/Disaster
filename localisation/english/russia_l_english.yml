russia.1.t:0 "The Status Quo"
russia.1.d:0 "It was a busy day in the Moscow streets, although the morning haze had laid itself down on the city, giving it a lazy atmosphere more befitting of some dreary town in the English countryside then Russia. The paperboys yelled out the morning headline, although befitting to the sleepy nature of this day, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Some local businessman, who's name would go anonymous, had unfortunately tripped and fell and landed directly on his neck while he had tried to pull up his pants. The crowds walked by, unassuming and unaware, especially of the five men who walked towards the central command building in Moscow. They were dressed in leather jackets and flat caps, a common sight in any of Russia's urban centres, and carrying packages filled with an unknown material. Deliverymen were by no means a rare sight, and their official and authoritative posture indicated that they had a purpose and a definite destination, rather then simply walking to a cafe or workplace. Their stride quickened as they passed the central command building, leaving behind a convenient and neat stack of packages addressed to the very building in which they stood in front of. None of the pedestrians surrounding the gate questioned the men, and the day went on normally as it would have any other day. Then, a flash, a bang, the front gates to the central command center were completely dissolved like water to paper, and the five men, who had taken a loop around the building until the time came, rushed into the government office. Many shots were heard in an instant, and just as quickly as it had began, those 5 men left the scene with pistols in hand and documents in the other. The people panicked, terrorism as such was familiar to those military men who had been stationed in the regions where Red and Left Guerrillas still roamed free, but in Moscow? It was almost unheard of, and in the comotion, those five men sunk back into the hazy, lazy day on those city streets, which had just become a little bit more dangerous. They were members of the Socialist Revolutionaries, and their time would come."
russia.1.a:0 "Oh..."

russia.2.t:0 "The Color Red"
russia.2.d:0 "Blood, guts, all that lovely stuff! Spread all over the lands of Russia in the futile mission to deprive the people of their will. Death follows in the wake of the White Army as their march towards oblivion nears, they shoot all the men they see who dare even bleed red. A purge of unearthly proportions, but why? Why must all the sons of Russia die, to satisfy the fears and paranoia of a drunk dictator? Decay, rot, it is everywhere, the fields lie untoiled and soiled as the men wished for land, the factories lay empty as the men wished for bread, and the colleges fall dark as the men wished for peace. The actions of the sinner, the great dictator of Russia, shall never be forgiven. Choose wisely! Who does history favour? The oppressor, or the oppressed? The purge shall continue for now, but soon Avalov shall meet a most deserving fate. Oh glorious death, why must we wait for your call?"
russia.2.a:0 "Purging is sustainable, right?"

russia.3.t:0 "Damnation to Democracy!"
russia.3.d:0 "The Duma is not a democratic institution in the true sense of the word, in fact many could see it closer to an oligarchical grouping then any sort of true Parliament. However, the Duma is also made up of men who, despite all of their fallings and failures, are not idiots. They realized that Avalovs' purge cannot be a sustainable means of conducting a country, and the population already loathes the government for its failures to industrialize or improve the nation in any sense of the word. So the Duma put forward a simple bill, the detainment, repression, and oppression of any group within Russia must first and foremost be passed and approved by the Duma, rather then through the autonomous action of the head of state. Saying Avalov did not react well to this is an understatement the size of Siberia, his blood boiled at the news, how dare those conniving bastards even think of trying to cross me? I was the one who gave them their jobs, I paid out the bribes, I rigged the elections, it was me dammit! They dare to protect the lives of some Red bastards just to, in their words, maintain stability? I'll show them some fucking stability! Avalov grabbed his pistol and his phone, both of which in recent weeks had seen plenty of use, but then slowly lowered them. Should I exercise some restraint? The Duma is the centre of my legitimacy, as poor as it is, and without it I am nothing but a dictator in the eyes of the people. Those snivelling commies had forced my hand, I had to maintain that wretched emblem of democracy even though it had cost him nothing but pain. But now was also the perfect opportunity, two birds with one stone, kill the Duma and continue the purge. The man sat in his chair, swivelling around to allow his mind the leisure of distraction, and to flood his thoughts into a space where they could be logically processed without unneeded burden."
russia.3.a:0 "To hell with the Duma, I am the state!"
russia.3.b:0 "Purge the Duma, but don't abolish it"

russia.4.t:0 "Consequences"
russia.4.d:0 "So, perhaps dissolving the Duma was a slightly hasty idea. This was the thought that crossed the mind of Avalov as the severed head of the police chief of Moscow was thrown over his palace walls. The people have erupted into massive riots across the nation, it turns out that the Duma really was the only thing between Avalov and political oblivion, but he was too far in to back out now. The people wanted his blood, the nation was again on fire, and civil war seemed like a distinct possibility, and it is all your fault. Thousands may die in these riots, but millions will die because of your actions, and you will never think anything of it, you're just a King playing with the lives of his countrymen like pawns. Death, destruction, rape, murder, it is entirely on Avalov, and whatever being chose to put him in power in the first place."
russia.4.a:0 "The cry of the unheard."

russia.5.t:0 "The King of Men"
russia.5.d:0 "Pavel Bermondt-Avalov was never a very socially conscious man, although he managed to become the leader of Russia, it was always as a result of compromise and brute force rather then political skill or tact. So it was not surprising when the most hated man in Russia declared himself the absolute supreme ruler of Russia, as the nation was burning itself down in a series of riots and civil upheavals due to his extremely misguided and not well thought out idea to dissolve the Duma, his sole organ of legitimacy, and drop all pretences. As Avalov listed off a dry recounting of his career as the savior of Russia over the radio, the few Russians with radios listened in about as intently as one would listen to a football game that had been 0-0 for two hours. He had no opposition, and yet he could simply not fester sympathy in all but the most reactionary of Russians, primarily in his own palace guard. This was perhaps the action of a man who had lost his mind, or the action of a man who's desperation had reached lunacy, but whichever reasoning, the new supreme ruler of Russia will soon find his title tested against the raw violence of a people with nothing to lose."
russia.5.a:0 "Here comes the flood."

russia.6.t:0 "Krasnyye in the Hills"
russia.6.d:0 "The Revolutionaries and Bolsheviks which had found themselves at the end a long spear named bitter defeat had never given up the fight completely. In the mountains and in the forests lay the Red Guerrillas, since marching to their battered drums, unwilling to accept defeat at the hands of the Whites. For Fascism is Capitalism in decay as comrade Lenin once said, and the people shall always march forwards to the future no matter the situation they find themselves in. Oh you Red Partisans, hiding in the forests, your time is nearly neigh, the clock ticks towards midnight in Russia, and more refugees join the Partisans ever day that passes. The attacks against the white garrisons in these regions ever increases, and the central government's grip on the countryside is weakened every passing hour. The flood shall come, and in its waves the whites shall be swept out of the glorious lands of Russia, and in its place? Peace! Land! Bread!"
russia.6.a:0 "A Historical Inevitability"

russia.7.t:0 "A Shell"
russia.7.d:0 "The Purged Duma that Avalov created has even less of the nominal democracy of its predecessor, in fact it is nothing but a shell of its former self. A few dozen men, corrupt beyond their own wildest dreams, sitting in a building far too large for their number, doing absolutely nothing. After all, they are not allowed to debate bills anymore, they are not allowed to even speak of the law. Empty men in empty buildings saying empty words with empty faces, nothing but a black pit of despair remains in the harrowed halls of the once great Duma. There might as well be no Duma at all, but in a state sometimes the quiet part must stay quiet, even if it is obvious that there is no democracy in Russia, the cover shall hold. The people, however, have not been fooled, and light protests have begun, let us hope this does not evolve into something far more dangerous, least Russia drowns in its own blood."
russia.7.a:0 "Democracy is a word, not a reality. "

russia.8.t:0 "A Soldier's Life"
russia.8.d:0 "Why must I fight for a man that imprisons my family and burns my fields? I was not asked to be a soldier you know, I was taken from my fields to serve in the army of some madman who styles himself a leader. I have no sympathy for his disgusting nature, his officers beat me for standing out of line, but they can not even afford to give me a rifle that fires more then one shot! To hell with this madness, I shall flee to the hills with my family, I may die in my attempt, but it is better to live free among family with Communists and Socialists then it is to spend another hour cleaning the boots of some fat aristocrat. The nation is full of men like me, men who wish for nothing but peace, and who find this situation disagreeable. Soon we shall rise like unconquerable bears, strong and fierce, and our families shall have the bread they seek, and we shall have the peace we desire. I flee to the hills so that Russia may one day be free, and one day the rifles that oppress our people shall point towards the men who order us and treat us as cattle."
russia.8.a:0 "Exactly how many men deserted?"

russia.9.t:0 "The Flood"
russia.9.d:0 "Well everyone saw this coming, the flood approaches and there is nothing you can do to stop it. The Bolsheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries have managed to form enough of an army to start occupying entire regions, and although there is no confirmation of civil war yet, it shall soon fall upon the great bear like an anvil. Your choices are limited, none of them are good, but they are all that we can do in the face of utter oblivion. Shall we deny the existence of this coming war at all? Live in a pretend land of wonder where the people still love us, and find ourselves dying horrible deaths, our bodies reduced to jelly by gunfire and blood. Shall we mobilize our army, cementing the fact of war and destruction upon the horizon, and acknowledging our fault in the horrific actions that shall be done in the name of ideology and the name of peace. Or shall we go a step further, mobilize and declare absolute martial law, and embrace everything that the people believe us to be? It is not as if they could believe we are even more evil then they already do, but this shall almost certainly make the reds gain even more support from the people. Your choices are bad, but the situation you created was poor from the start. Avalov was doomed from the very beginning, a white government could never truly cement itself into Russia without the mass murder of all of those who dared to even blink against it. But if you manage to succeed supreme leader, I will be pleasantly surprised, but as it stands, you are doomed. Say your prayers to God, the Red Flood is going to wash over Russia and destroy all of the statues and the legacy that you built, and no matter the choice you make, you are powerless to stop it. Pray, and hope, and wish to the angels that you shall keep your power."
russia.9.a:0 "I choose devastation, I'm taking you fuckers with me!"
russia.9.b:0 "I choose blood, mobilize the army!"
russia.9.c:0 "choose ignorance, there are no Reds in the countryside"

russia.10.t:0 "The Fire"
russia.10.d:0 "The moment has come, with cold determination and the fierce spirit of resistance which had permeated almost two decades of constant guerrilla warfare, the reds finally shot their first true shots since the first civil war. The white garrison, unprepared despite all of their pomp and pride, fell like wheat to the sickle of the people. The lands shall now be drenched in blood, sweat, and tears. Russia is again collapsing, the central government has no control anywhere but the capital and surrounding area. The fire rages, and Russia shall be burnt alive, its people screaming in agony, as the gears of war crush all the humanity that remained in their already destitute state. The priest pray, the soldiers yell, the people scream, death, agony, Russia writhes. Let us hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, for the sake of humanity."

russia.13.d:0 "Drozdovsky had always been a man resigned to his fate. Once he saw the barrels of the young Revolutionaries who had broke into his compound, he knew that he was facing death in the face. He had been drinking a morning tea at the time, and taking some notes for the coming days ahead. Despite the gun in his face, he remained determined to take a second sip of tea, one that was interrupted by the splattering of his brains against the floral wall backdrop of his quarters. He was dead, in an instant, and the Russian government had rallied around him as a martyr of the anti-revolutionary struggle. Of course in the propagandizing of his death it was said he took twelve of his assassins with him, but that was something that would have fit a much younger and a very different man. Despite that his funeral was flown with the brightest of colors and the most medals that could be given, all the pomp and fluster of a regime at death's door. The man was dead, and the casket was closed due to the man no longer having a head as much as a vague head shaped protrusion. Avalov of course used this opportunity for one reason and one reason alone, there must be a purge of all left leaning individuals within Russia so that she may be safe from the terrorist threat! And as his hate filled words flew out of his mouth like the bullets that had shot the very man he supposedly preached for, a crow and a vulture together flew overhead"
