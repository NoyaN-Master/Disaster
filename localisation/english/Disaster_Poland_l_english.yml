PLN_a_perfect_democracy:0 "A Spotless Democracy?"
PLN_a_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "Endecja, together with it's allies, has dominated Polish politics for as long as anyone can remember. Yet this doesn't come without challenges, which grow in number with each passing decade. The uncertainty that has dominated recent years must resolved, lest we allow our system to falter."

PLN_churchs_role_desc:0 "While the Polish Church already enjoys certain privileges, some elements in our party say that it's not enough. They call for a deepening of relations between our government and the ecclesiastical body."
PLN_support_polish_business:0 "Support Polish Business"

PLN_army_woes:0 "Army Woes"
PLN_army_woes_desc:0 "With his conflict with Dmowski proving too problematic for his career, General Haller was forced into exile in Switzerland, which caused a great impact on our army. Day by day more soldiers are leaving their duty behind to follow their leader, much to our chagrin."
PLN_remove_prussian_vestiges:0 "Remove Vestiges of Prussianism"
PLN_remove_prussian_vestiges_desc:0 "On the surface, our nation is indeed free from the Prussian yoke, but this may be a rather idealistic view of the true situation. Numerous street names, shops, instiutions and so on are still afflicted with what Dmowski calls 'The Disease of Germanism'. A quick removal of that cancer shall heal our nation."
PLN_deal_with_socialist_terrorists:0 "Deal with Socialist Terrorists"
PLN_deal_with_socialist_terrorists_desc:0 "At first we have tolerated them and what did they do? They bit the gentle hand that was offered from the government. Ordinary Poles have suffered too much from their hands already. We need to deal with the socialist terror right now, especially with those bastards in the Revolutionary Faction."
PLN_hunt_pilsudski:0 "Hunt Piłsudski"
PLN_hunt_pilsudski_desc:0 "That charlatan Piłsudski was always a thorn in not only Endecja's side, but Poland's as well. Most people nowadays see him as a harmless old man, not capable of doing anything major, but Dmowskis feels that his longtime rival hides a more sinister side, one which cannot be allowed to threaten Poland."

### Ideas ###
PLN_free_at_fast:0 "Free at Last"
PLN_free_at_fast_desc:0 "After 123 years Poland is free, yet the deeds of old heroes that gave their life for her are still fresh in people's memories. Inspired by their example, this time Poles won't go down without a fight."
PLN_minorities_and_borders:0 "Minorities and Borders"
PLN_minorities_and_borders_desc:0 "Even though the final shape of Poland is mostly an ethnically homogenous state, as Dmowski wanted, there are still many minorities within our borders, some being at odds with the Endecja government. This situation isn't helped by the political instability beyond the eastern border."
PLN_leftist_organizations:0 "Leftist Organizations"
PLN_leftist_organizations_desc:0 "While most of the population favours political conservatism, there are still substantial elements on the left side of the spectrum. Spurred on by the Endecja's longstanding political dominance, various socialist organizations oppose the government, with their methods ranging from peaceful to violent. The most radical group of them all is the Revolutionary Faction."
PLN_catholic_support:0 "Catholic Support"
PLN_catholic_support_desc:0 "The Catholic Church was always deeply tied to the nation, keeping the identity and traditions of Poland alive when its statehood was gone. At present, the faithful and clergy are willing to support a government that respects their interests."

### Events ###
pln.1.t:0 "Rzeczpospolita in 1936"
pln.1.d:0 "Poland, a nation that suffered 123 years of foreign oppression, is once again free. With the end of the Great War, all three powers that partitioned and tried to erase the Polish nation fell. However, this didn't prove to be the end of Poland's problems. While Dmowski's delegation fought at the failed Paris Peace Conference to achieve the best terms they could for the young nation, the newly born state fell into chaos. West Ukrainian armies, revolutionary militias, and remnants of the German army all threatened the security of the Second Polish Republic. This impending disaster, however, was averted in the nick of time when Roman Dmowski, along with Józef Haller's Blue Army, returned from France. Once the nation's frontiers had been secured, the nascent Polish government now had to organise a modern state. Dmowski's early efforts were disrupted by Józef Piłsudski, who attempted to forcefully take over, only to be beaten back by Haller's forces. \nWith an alliance of right-wing parties dominated by National Democracy frequently coming out on top in elections, Poland enjoyed a slow but steady growth. This tranquility is now threatened, however, by growing internal discontent and Dmowski's worsening health. If there ever comes a dark day when something happens to the Father of the Polish Nation, the fate of Poland will hang in balance."
