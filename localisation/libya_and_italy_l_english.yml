 TIT_Forgotten_Colony_desc:0 "Italy, our beloved homeland has for all intents and purposes forgotten us. There was a time when the coasts of Anatolia were filled with Italian beauties here on a tourist trap disguised as a functioning colony, and our garrison was just a whole bunch of baby-faced recruits fresh out of boot camp hitting on those aforementioned beauties, but those times have long since passed. Due to the Italian civil war and economic downturn caused by the collapse of the united states, our once prosperous tourism industry collapsed. Since the colony couldn't run on bananas alone a new source of income was gravely needed. With our homeland in political turmoil and the colony bleeding cash, an "unusual" source of income was founded by the then newly appointed governor-general Mario Roatta. Ever since Roatta's appointment the colony has been turning a profit despite the lack of tourism, and while it is difficult to explain why there are so many ghost towns, and why Turkish guerilla fighters have increased exponentially under Roatta, as long as nothing major happens and the colony keeps turning a profit our homeland will continue to live in blissful ignorance"
 TIT_Legacy_Rhodes_desc:0 "Our army and officials need morale and inspiration to run this hellhole. We look back to our past, and to the Knights of Rhodes, the proud knights that safeguarded Christ's reign in Smyrna and Rhodes until the vicious, barbaric Turks came and pillaged them. Now 400 or so years after the turk despoiled the holy lands of Christendom, we have arrived. And it's due time for the turks to reap what they sowed all those years ago"
