KUR_hamidiye_army_desc:0"A reformation of the original Tribal cavalry formed under Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the Hamidian Tribal Cavalry, or simply the Hamidiye, were a formation of light cavalry forces that found their use as a frontier and border protection force alongside policing activities in regions such as Armenia and Kurdistan. However as Kurdistan has become a independent state within its own right, the only remaining truly military forces loyal to the Kurds in the region were the Hamidiye. Despite their adhoc nation from frontier light cavalry force to the entire armed forces of the nation, they remain an extremely effective force, especially in the terrain of Kurdistan, and are loyal to their tribe and nation to a extreme degree."
