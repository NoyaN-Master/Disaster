ARM_Lusignan_Debacle_desc:0 "France's failure to gain any Middle Eastern land in the aftermath of the Great War caused them to not deliver on their promise of material help for our nation. They also never pressured the Turkish government in Cilicia to keep the Armenians there safe. This has led to a massive public blow against Mihran Damadian, who is the chief architect of the Franco-Armenian agreement."

ARM_Damadians_Folly:0 "Damadian's Folly"
ARM_Damadians_Folly_desc:0 "Despite his best intentions, Mihran Damadian failed to secure adequate French support. Not only that, but he also failed to stop the advance of Enverist armies. Perhaps it is high time for a change in management..."

ARM_Nzhdehs_Commandos:0 "Nzhdeh's Commandos"
ARM_Nzhdehs_Commandos_desc:0 "With Nzdeh in charge of the nation more and more underground cells of Armenian Liberation Forces are becoming active. They are forming a new vanguard that will push Enver to the sea, from where he cannot escape."

ARM_Beat_Back_the_Maniacs:0 "Beat Back the Maniacs"
ARM_Beat_Back_the_Maniacs_desc:0 "There is no other way to put it, the Turks under Enver's command are nothing more than maniacs. They and their leader are hellbent on wiping our people from the face of this Earth. We have to stop them, no matter the cost."

ARM_Return_of_the_Exiles_desc:0 "With our campaign against Enver going well many in the Armenian diaspora chose to return to their homeland, so they can help in our greatest struggle thus far. They also brought much needed equipment to fuel our war effort."

ARM_Avenge_Nagorno_Karabakh_desc:0 "While we were in a life and death struggle against Enver, the government of Azerbaijan carried out numerous massacres against Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. What is even more damning, they intended to join Enver after we fell. We have full right to teach them humility now."

ARM_Secure_the_Eastern_Flank:0 "Secure the Eastern Flank"
ARM_Secure_the_Eastern_Flank_desc:0 "After our success in the Azeri War, we have to decide how best to secure the newly gained lands. Not only the native Armenian, but also those inhabited by Azeri Turks."

ARM_Guardians_of_the_Kurds:0 "Guardians of the Kurds"
ARM_Guardians_of_the_Kurds_desc:0 "Perhaps only the Kurds can feel the same as Armenians do, for they were also heavily persecuted by Turkish governments. This logically means that only we can ensure their survival by creating a joined nation with them."

ARM_Rebuild_with_the_Newfound_Profits_desc:0 "With the black gold flowing from the Caspian oil fields, our economic standing has never been so great. We can finally start the projects of rebuilding Nagorno-Karabakh after what the Azeri government did to it."

ARM_Cilician_Promise:0 "Cilician Promise"
ARM_Cilician_Promise_desc:0 "After all those years since they Great War, the promise that the French government gave to Damadian finally came true. With international pressure on the regime controlling Cilicia, the lands that are by historical right Armenian can finally come back to us."

ARM_Neo_Crusaders_Zeal_desc:0 "Many new recruits in the Armenian Legion do not come from our lands, but from foreign nations instead. They are here because of the promise that a great and ancient evil will be vanquished. Who are we to deny their zeal?"

ARM_Protect_the_Common_Folk:0 "Protect the Common Folk"
ARM_Protect_the_Common_Folk_desc:0 "We didn't come to Trabazon for some sort of a misguided revenge fantasy. We are not the monsters that all of Turkish history tried to make us out to be.

ARM_Pax_Aeternam_desc:0 "Now that the core of unified Armenian lands is secured, we can turn our attention to the squabbling warlords of the west.

ARM_Damadians_Redemption:0 "Damadian's Redemption"
ARM_Damadians_Redemption_desc:0 "Perhaps we were too blind to see what Mihran Damadian did for our nation. Without his government, the republic would never exist.

ARM_Reward_our_Hellenic_Friends_desc:0 "The Hellenes have a history similar to ours. Their people were also subjugated and opressed by the Ottoman Empire and it's successors. With the recent loss of Smyrna, we could use this occasion to return their ancestral territories and cement an alliance."

ARM_Status_of_Anatolia:0 "Status of Anatolia"
ARM_Status_of_Anatolia_desc:0 "Pacification of Anatolia has been both a blessing and a curse for Armenians.

ARM_Keep_them_Contained:0 "Keep them Contained"
ARM_Keep_them_Contained_desc:0 "See how the things have changed? It is no longer the Turks that are dominating Armenians, but vice versa. Yet, they are still filled with hate towards our people.

ARM_Destroy_the_Personality_Cults:0 "Destroy the Personality Cults"
ARM_Destroy_the_Personality_Cults_desc:0 "If there is a thing to be blamed as one of the main causes of Turks genocidal nature, it would be their blind devotion to leaders.

For Turks, there will be no gods, no kings, no masters."

ARM_Contact_Hikmet:0 "Contact Hikmet"
ARM_Contact_Hikmet_desc:0 "When the many socialists of Turkey have waged merciless campaigns against any minorities in the name of 'workers liberation', one man stood as a beacon of hope for all those living in Anatolia, not only the Turks.

ARM_Mordacqs_Administration:0 "Mordacq's Administration"
ARM_Mordacqs_Administration_desc:0 "There is much work before Governor Mordacq when it comes to securing the new French Mandate of Anatolia. It is by no means an easy task, yet with our help the profits from the new French acquisition will become clear to see."

### Events ###
drlarm.1.t:0 "The Hero Rises"
drlarm.1.d:0 "Damadian's failure to beat back the hordes coming from Trabzon has caused many in our military to grow tired of the ineffective Ramgavar government. With no sight of the promised help, it's time for the government to step down in favor of a temporary junta headed by Garegin Nzhdeh.""
drlarm.1.a:0 "For Nzdeh, for Armenia!"

drlarm.2.t:0 "Reorganizing Azerbaijan"
drlarm.2.d:0 "The conquest of Azerbaijan left us in a difficult position, namely, what to do with the old provincial structures and local governments. While our soldiers are fighting off hostile mayors and other civilian leaders, the administrative corps has drawn up a plan to divide Azerbaijan into majority Armenian Artsakh and majority Azeri Caspia."
drlarm.2.a:0 "Let us welcome the birth of the Provinces of Artsakh & Caspia."

drlarm.3.t:0 "French Support Arrives"
drlarm.3.d:0 "Despite their initial failure to deliver the promised supplies, the French garrison in Crimea has not only sent us the equipment we need, but also 3 divisions of the so-called Armenian Legion formed originally in France."
drlarm.3.a:0 "If only Constantine II did as much centuries ago."

drlarm.4.t:0 "Damnatio Memoriae"
drlarm.4.d:0 "The man who caused Armenia and it's people so much grief has been finally captured. Despite all the pretense of being a magnificent hero of legend, he was hiding like a common bandit in one of the coastal forests around Trabzon.\n\n'Ismail Enver Pasha. For your crimes against the nation of Armenia, the slaugher of innocent civilians and destruction of the land under your governorship, this court hereby sentences you to death by fire. May you know in your last moments the suffering you caused the common people of Armenia.'\n\nAnd so with that, one of history's greatest monsters has been tied to a pyre. To burn in this life and forver in his afterlife."
drlarm.4.a:0 "Don't keep the Devil waiting, you genocidal madman."

drlarm.5.t:0 "Against the Forces of Spiritual Evil"
drlarm.5.d:0 "Despite what some may claim, we do not desire revenge against the ordinary people of Turkey. If we were to do so, we would be no better than the genocidal maniacs that slaughtered our nation.\nOur army is tirelessly keeping the remaining forces of Enver at bay. Saving the people of Trabazon, be they Armenians or Turks.\n\nFor our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world."
drlarm.5.a:0 "The hosts of wickedness, vanquished."

drlarm.6.t:0 "Solemn Eulogy"
drlarm.6.d:0 "Enver and his army of bloodthirsty bandits is gone. In moments like these the entire nation should rejoice, for their opressor is gone. Yet nothing remains but tears, tears over all the lifes lost before and all those that will be lost in the future.\n\nEven the most righteous vengeance cannot bring back those who were killed without mercy. No matter how many hostile Turkish armies will be sent to their graves, nothing can bring back the Armenian soldiers who were lost, simply because they wanted to keep their families safe.\n\nNothing will bring back the millions that died just because they were living in their ancestral lands when a genocidal regime was fighting a war. One can only hope that their sacrifice will not be in vein and that their memory will never be lost."
drlarm.6.a:0 "While your names are lost, your suffering will never be forgotten."

drlarm.7.t:0 "The First Elections of Unified Armenia"
drlarm.7.d:0 "Repbulic of Armenia from the very beginning was a nation founded on strong principles of democracy and freedom. While democratic elecetions were suspended by Nzdeh's Junta during the Wars of Unification, he decided that the time is finally right to step down and allow a democratic government to return.\nNow the entire population of Armenia that's eligible to vote asks one question. Who shall win the Grand Election?"
drlarm.7.a:0 "The Revolutionary Federation secured our freedom. Elect the hereos of Armenia!"
drlarm.7.b:0 "Social Democrats have been instrumental in running the civilian government. They deserve their position!"
drlarm.7.c:0 "Without Damadian there would be no french support for our struggle. Ramgavar it is!"

drlarm.8.t:0 "Anatolia Moving Forward"
drlarm.8.d:0 "There is no need to hide the truth, our occupation of Anatolia hasn't gone exactly as we planned.\nAlthough the Security Forces are doing their best to crush the remnants of warlordist armies, the population is less than receptive to being ruled by a foreign power. If we don't choose the right course of action Anatolia might descend into bloodshed once more."
drlarm.8.a:0 "The future of Anatolia needs to be handled with utmost caution."

drlarm.9.t:0 "Demands from Armenia"
drlarm.9.d:0 "The Armenians, with support from the French, have demanded the province of Adana, and are pressuring war if we don't concede."
drl.9.a:0 "Never!"
drl.9.b:0 "We cannot afford a war, we must give in..."
