 ANT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In this world, even the victors lose. Even in the eyes of Crown, the Anatolian Sovereignty is just a failed experiment, where anarchy reins and mercenaries run free, while the locals watch in anger and disgust. While some shamelessly collaborate with the authorities, others -like Ethem's revolutionaries- organize to overthrow the shameless occupiers. At the same time, men like J. F. C Fuller are waiting for the collapse and preparing by setting themselves up at the heads of large and cruel mercenary armies. Will the abandoned protectorate finally fall to pieces? Or will its brutal leadership endure the brutal Anatolian slaughter?"
 CIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the Entente may have only aimed to punish those who stood in their way, one man suffered more than most at their hand. Ismail Enver Pasha, one of three Young Turks was always the most radical of the three. He envisioned a state, stretching from the Balkans to the eastern most part of Siberia, for Turks and Turks alone. But now he stands defeated and branded as a traitor, with little support and many enemies. And though his choices may be limited, his will remains the same..."
 WRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Just like its Central Power allies, the Ottomans ended up dismembered and humiliated. The ancient lands of Anatolia, once so mighty and brave now stand completely in ruins. Differing factions fight eachother in the name of crazed ideologies, like rabid dogs. Only Mustafa Kemal, "Ataturk", still stands proudly against these madmen, preaching for a state for the Turkish people, where men and women are all equal. Basing his vision off of the French Republics, with a firm belief in the values of secularism and modernity, Mustafa Kemal is ready to bring Turkey into a new age."

Getting dressed in a shiny black uniform  tailored by a German designer during the war, he headed out, wandering through the barracks to reach the command room. This former Ottoman prision in Van was still rusty, only recently being turned into a military building.  The Pasha sighed with bitternes, seeing how his once proud army was reduced to guaridng rotting buildings. While he was walking, he heard  noises coming from the command room. In anticipation of a hostile encounter, he grabbed his knife and a pistol, as the Caucasian tradition taught. Enver  blasted the door open to see Samet, his right hand man messing with maps and intel gathered from the Armenian bandits. Enver quickly grabbed him, shaking him for the explantion of his behaviour. The officers were not allowed to wake up until the Pasha did, much less enter the command room without his permision. \n 'I was crafting a plan, my Pasha!' said Samet, angrily staring at the Pasha. 'Then instead of walking in the command room like some illiterate Armenian thug, you'd better tell me if this 'plan' of yours is worth it!' Enver replied. Samet took his notebook and showed his war plans to the Pasha. \n 'You see my Pasha, the conquest of Eastern Turkish and Armenian territories have granted us strategic power in the mountains and Caucasus. Our state's greater ambition is to re-unify Anatolia into a strong Turkish nation, and doing so would require much more territory and resources. My plan is to strike south. at the  loose confederation of Kurdish tribes, named the Ashirats. Their central authority is non-existent, not to mention that their traditionalist outlook on militarism forces them to act like some lycee bully instead of a proper fighting force. We should seize their lands, use their men and women as slave workers, assimilate their children into our creed, exploit their agriculture and show them the real Turkish force.'\n Enver listened to his plan in admiration and geniunity. Even though he thought some terms that Samet used were radical, like forced slavery, he wasn't a very different man after all. 'You're pretty good. now go and wake up the shock troopers, raze those Zagros rats!' the pasha exclaimed with  the last shreds of joy that he still has in his older  years.\nSamet was gaining influence in the military academy, and now to be admired by the Pasha himself.

Some time went and punishment was clear: Execution with rope. Damadian shouted in fear, begging for mercy but no one reacted except Envers bitter smile. He had never felt more satisfied.

The doctors told him to relax but today was only a brief moment of  respite, there was still much to do. The issues of sectarian violence, new constitution, workers’ rights, female suffrage, new army laws and countless others couldn’t allow for Kemal to just rest.\n„Sir, is everything alright?” Ismet Inonu waited patiently for the Pasha to notice his entrance.\n„The fate of the nation is at stake. We may have won the war against Enver and other traitors, but there are still many issues plaguing Turkey. I can’t allow myself to sit and relax while the nation suffers, as those pathetic doctors  suggest. I am a statesman first, I would give my life for the nation if need be!” Mustafa Kemal exclaimed with a vigor not of an old and tired politician, but a young and charismatic leader.\n„Sir, I came here to take your orders on the matter of security in the eastern provinces.  Will the local police be enough or are we to send military forces to keep order? I am sure you would rather delegate this matter to your  subordinates, since dealing with the sickness must be ve-” right as the word sickness escaped Ismet’s mouth he heard a cane strike the floor.\n„Sickness, what sickness? Throughout this whole year I was active on the front lines, leading my men to glory, sharing their burdens. And now that the country is barely unified my council thinks I’m too ill to continue my work! I will n-”  the Pasha suddenly felt weak and was caught by Ismet before collapsing.\n„Kemal, listen to me. We all have seen those bloodied napkins, your sudden bouts of coughing, the empty cigar boxes and new diary entries. We do not wish for you to end like an old and powerless man, but you have to understand that if you continue like this there will be no one to lead Turkey!”\nThe Pasha was disappointed. Chiefly with himself for allowing his ailing state to show. But this only strengthened his resolve to go forth with the work his entire life was spent on. “Ismet, you are going east together with the soldiers,  aren’t you?

Following his sudden onset of of cirrhosis, Ataturk had gone to Istanbul for treatment, however, despite the doctors' best efforts, it was already too late.He still tried going on with his lifestyle as usual, heading to Council of Ministers meetings and taking care of his other political duties, as if nothing was wrong, but eventually his illness proved too much for him and today, our dear leader has sadly passed away.His death has sent our nation into shock and sorrow, with many people wondering why it had to come so soon. His funeral has been scheduled to happen a few weeks from now, and while the future of our country may look uncertain, what is certain to everyone is that Ataturk's legacy will be felt in Turkey for ages to come."

Alongside that, he has also begun cracking down on other political parties within the nation, in order to maintain the current one party system and to make the country more united."

The Bursa Trials are concluded but Samet and his autonomous battalions are speculated to have ran east and also may be recruiting the Kemal-leaning soldiers from our army. On the other page, we have the situation of the country. Nationalists, Ottomanists and most youth supports our cause after we have shown how the Kemalists were weak Western assets to rule Anatolia from the shadows but some estates like the Liberals, Communists and Minorities are not really pleased with our triumph. The last breifing is about what the populace thinks of you, my pasha. Most citizens from the western parts are divided on the matter, some hailing you as a war hero and some believing you are the cause of this 'Disaster'. The East is purely on our side, and many Ethemite militarists are flocking from the Spartakist order to our Black Legions. We are leaving the case here and you, My Pasha, are the grandest authority to react to this issues."\n The officers all threw a salute and chanted "Emredin Paşam!". Enver smiled and put on his coat.\n "What I want to do further on is no more bloody conquest and brother wars but to unify the entire country under my rule. I have failed to hug Anatolia when I was the War Minister BUT I will not fail again. From Thrace to Hakkari, the chants of 'Türküm, Doğruyum, Çalışkanım!' will echo the mountains. Form the Straits to the Fertile Crescent, the name of Turkey will be accepted as a noble asset. I am here to rule over my people, and craft my legacy as a knight of Allah. There is no place for pessimism and Nihilism currently. You young generals are all promoted to your upper ranks, and go to the ranksmaster to claim your new badges. Today is a new day in Turkish history, one that will mark the end of the Decline and start the Ascension."\n The soldiers were impressed and complied with the orders, and while they were going to the ranksmaster, one said\n "The Pasha looks healthy now.

Over time, certain men had to act against this tyranny, one of them being Mustafa Kemal Pasha. \n The Pasha was a known general and a famed social icon in Anatolia thanks to his Turko-centric approach to the Ottoman Empire and his nationalism. After the peninsula fell to Western powers, he gathered his fellow comrades Ismet, Fevzi, Kazım and Enver. His relationship with Enver was tacky since they only cooperated to repel back the Europeans. In 1925, the pashas and their militants were planning their uprising in Ankara, just to be busted in by the British colonial police force. The infiltrator was never found, but many rumors spread around on it's identity. During the raid, Kemal and a big portion of his generals and militants succeded in their escape, leaving behind Enver and his clique of militants. Arrested by the British, Enver is exiled to Ukraine, where he spent some years as a colonel. \n After the incident, the generals, now known as the Kemalists, have scattered all around Anatolia. Ismet in Thrace, Fevzi in Adana and Orbay in Ankara. Kemal was around Manisa, a small city close to Smyrna. Between 1927 and 1933, the Kemalists have made significant gains in guerilla warfare and raids after the colonial hold in Greek occupied regions faded away because of the nation's economic and political problems. Now occupying most of Western Turkey and the conservative regions of Konya, Kemal was prideful only until 1933 where the First Anatolian Crisis happened, where guerilla warfare between General Fuller and the communists in the British Mandate went hot and certain organizations in Anatolia started seceding from their colonial overlords. The secession of the communists gave morale to the reactionary islamists of the Konya region against Kemal's secular leanings, causing the Great Reactionary Revolt. Since Kemal couldn't fight in so many fronts, actively raiding Smyrna, keeping the islamists away from Bursa and safeguarding the borders against any communist bandits, Kemal had to create The Caliphate, an islamic ulema state ruled by the last islamic caliph. This occurance has left a big scar in the Pasha's heart and his fuel to unify Turkey under his vision started burn much more. Now in 1936, The Pasha has the Linguist movement, a radical Anti-Kemalist movement with totalitarian and militaristic aims, to contain and a final battle to fight in Smyrna. The British Mandate is not really stable and the atrocities commited in Antalya will be used as claims to absorb the Roatta Legion into the Kemalist Order with D'Annunzio's own help. Only god knows what seeks ahead."

After the peninsula fell to Western powers, he cooperated with his ex-comrades, the Kemalists, consisting of Kemal himself, Ismet, Fevzi and Orbay pashas.

Arrested by the British, Enver is exiled to Ukraine where he joined the Black Army and teached the anarchists the art of war and governence. Always blaming Kemal for his arrest and exile, he moved to the Mountain Republic around 1928, arming the Dagetanis against the Georgian guerillas. After a year in Mountain Republic, Enver moves to Baku, the city that he swore to take with his Caucasian Islamic Army in The Great War. Enver's brother, Nuri Bey, would do anything for his brother's redemption in Anatolia so Enver starts demanding propaganda posters of Turkist and Anti-Armenian actions to be displayed all over Anatolia. Slowly raising a generation of Enver admirers, Nuri Bey becomes a sattelite of Enver in Anatolia. After gaining a big following in Azerbaijan, the Azeri government sends a Armenian hitman to take out Enver, which Enver escapes from and runs away to Trabzon in 1934. Since his arrival in Trabzon, he was welcomed by the local nationalist and conservative folk, and raised a big army from conscripts all around Anatolia and from Trabzon. Re-creating the Caucasian Army as the Caucasian Islamic Brigade, Enver declares total destruction of Armenian occupation over Anatolia in 1 January, 1936. From now on, his goal is to unify Anatolia under his fist and redeem  himself to his people, to pardon all the crimes he commited such as signing the Istanbul Treaty."

 ant.1.d:0 "After the British mandate was set up the governors were very happy to govern another useless piece of shit land with no effort but they soon realized they all ended up hanged, dead or taken their own lives.\n The Anatolian Mandate started off as a paradise for European skilled laborers, young British soldiers and European mercenaries with cheap prices, awesome geography and a profitable Black Sea trade route. As time passed, the local Turks were pissed off living under the claws of the British so they started organizing. Organizations mostly consisted of young students and old war veterans and aimed attacks on British soldiers and assets in the region. In a short time these organizations became extremist political entities, such as Ethem Nejat's TKP with a militant Unisocialist outlook or Nazım's Maoist guerillas in the mountains. To combat this epidemic of political guerillas, the Mandate commisioned a marshall to lead the armies of the colony in order to eliminate them. \n J.F.C Fuller was chosen as the marshall. A occultist, far-right symphatizer with a good history with tank warfare and usage of chemicals. From the day he set foot on the Mandate, the region changed forever. Fuller formed his political cult amongst nationalist European laborers, soldiers, some mercenaries and influenced some politicans in the Collabration Government. Fuller made his tactics more radical over time, creating new forms of guerilla warfare, razing of entire villages and experimentation of new chemical weapons, which destroyed his skin and mentla health over time. In 1933, the First Anatolian Crisis happened which the battle between the Communists and Fuller went hot. Fuller had no regrets and threatened to destroy the entire city of Sinop which was a hotbed of the Mandate so the government stopped attacks on the guerillas, which ended the conflict and secured peace. Understanding how risky is it to give Fuller complete military command, the government commisioned Mad Jack, a famed British mercenary, to come command the European mercenaries in the mandate. Jack accepted, and quickly became a figure for apolitical Turks and mercenaries. Now in 1936, Fuller plans a coup against the government. Will the government concede into chaos, or will they give it to Fuller to fix the mess?"

The shame he had felt had pushed him forwards, it had made him a stronger man after all, and it had made the people love him after all his deeds he had done. But now there was nothing there, nothing but a pit like a olive without its seed. Still, it is one last chance to gloat against an enemy who had made him run down this terrible path, he should take solace in that. The home where they were holding Kemal was just up ahead, and after a rather sloppy job of parking Enver left the car behind and ventured into one of his final battles, at least a metaphorical one. The inside of the home was pleasant, as what would be afforded to such a man, with only a single armed guard watching the man who now sat on the couch in the middle of the room. Bottles of various liquors and rakı found themselves strewn around the floor and any raised surface, and the whole room smelled like a cigar factory. The man in the center of this temple of regret was sunken, defeated, his soul had been wretched from his body like a bottle of champagne and it's cork, leaving his spirit pouring out. Enver shook himself out of it, there was no point in length poetic drivel when dealing with such a man, a great betrayer of the people and of Enver himself. Enver approached the couch and sat besides Kemal, the man didn't even look up, it was clear he was expecting death and nothing less, and despite his strength it still frightened him so. Enver spoke softly "Mustafa, I am aware of how you feel, but I have not come here to end your life, I would do nothing of the sort." Kemal looked up with tired eyes, although he seemed to believe him it didn't seem to make him feel any better. "You shall be taken care of, we have put aside a lovely countryside manor to live in. As long as you promise to never, under any circumstances, approach politics again." The last sentence was said with harsh force, but Atatürk nodded weaky. Enver had intended to say nothing further, this trip was just one final element of putting his soul to rest, but he felt as if he couldn't leave his one time brother in nothing but dread. "Brother" Enver said as he left the house, "Good luck to you.""

The war of brothers that had wrecked the nation for years had seen to destroy most of the remaining office buildings and safe meeting spaces, leading to the slightly desperate use of these such bunkers. A phonograph was playing some traditional music above the two men as the men who were guarding the meeting sat and played cards, and the smell of rations drifted down into the bunker below. The two men sat across from one another, staring into each others souls, the old wolf and the teacher, men who in different times would have slit each others throats over the slightly provocation. Still, in these strange times the two recognised that they would both need each other for progress to be made by any means. Ethem himself was a Pan-Turkist, and a Nationalist, and the corporatism of the Enver regime could be seen as preferable to the mere liberal capitalism of the west or the social democracy of the Kemalists. The deal Enver provided was square and fair, the Ethemists would be able to maintain their political independence as an article within the Enverist coalition, and push their ideas on the political stage, however they must maintain absolute loyalty to the man of Enver rather then his party. The alliance was not one of politics as much as of pragmatism, Enver did not care as much as people thought, only their loyalty to his objective. The teacher made his choice, he would support the idea and pass it down to the cadres, but he gave the Wolf a warning, "We may function as comrades now, but betray our people and one million knives shall fall onto your back.". Enver was not an idiot, he had lived long enough to understand the threat such an ally would pose as an enemy, so peace shall reign, at least for today."

 enver.32.d:0 "Enver had never been fond of Monarchists, he had supported his Emperor long ago, sure, but that support had come from a wish for stability rather then ideological fervor. His plan for national renewal had never included returning an Emperor to the throne, and in fact it still didn't. However he was also aware that the Royalists were not exactly a most bright bunch, and with some vague promises and a few titles thrown around, he could acquire their support with ease. The promises he ended up having to make were many unfortunately, but many of them were long term to a degree where any dissenters of the future could easily be purged, and the records of such promises could be erased. Why of course I will declare myself regent and place the royalty back on the throne, why of course I am still loyal to the Empire, who wouldn't be? White lies and some large black ones smoothed over relations better then tar on pavement, and the Monarchists quickly caved in and declared Enver the new Regent. Enver realized that in the future this might provide some difficulty, but the most important issue of the present was uniting the nation, what may come later is something to worry about when the country had a degree of stability at all."

He was here to do something that needed to be done, as the great Pasha had come to learn over his short time ruling a proper country, the extreme radicalism he had promoted had only continued to ravage the very nation he had sought to unify. Flies come more to sugar then salt after all, and there was no way he might solidify his nation without a binding of both."Fellow comrades of the great Turkish nation and it's ambitions, you have fought for years on your path to seek redemption and unification across our lands. You, my soldiers, fought through the lands of the scarred devil, the mercenary, the socialist, the Islamist, and the traitor. You fought through these lands with your only expectation being complete victory and the passion that drove you remains in your heart to this day. But I have come as your father to tell you, we must not let ourselves be blinded by ideology. The death of many of our great Turkic states has come from the Army finding itself in service to ideas and not nations, to faith and not the people. Do you not remember our failures, our horrible blunders, the ones that caused us so much suffering? We were blinded, blinded by the presence of the cloud of belief over our good senses and good fortunes. I ask you, my lions, to calm yourselves so we may not make the same mistake we did in the past, and so that the great Turkic lands may find themselves one, from Finland to Mongolia!."Cheers and whoops rang out from the massive crowd, deafening screams of approval despite the words he had said.

The people had seen the beauty and truth in the Turanist ideal, a united state from Finland to Turkey to Siberia, and the time they wished was coming. The telegram he had received from Enver was as gracious as possible, one thousand blessings here, two million blessings there, and although the overly honoring nature of the letter made Ziya uncomfortable in some areas, it still did the job it set out to do. The answer was obvious from the beginning, of course it was a yes, the two were practically brothers in their beliefs and will, but then Ziya slowed down. He had heard of the brutality of Enver, he was not a blind man and he could see the bloody conflict from his own borders and what it hath wrought. Would he truly be safe from the Mad Pasha even if he put himself as his ally? Perhaps, perhaps not, but the benefits of the destruction of Turkestan and the addition of new lands to the great and most powerful Turkish state could not be understated. Against perhaps his better judgement as a educated man, Ziya agreed to assist Enver in his expedition and provide himself as an ally wherever possible. By the will of God this won't come back to bite him later."

The camel rider was of course for show as it was tradition, Yahya had installed a small telegram line decades ago, but any important message from a foreign leader was to be treated as it had under the great Imams of the middle ages. The letter was written in Arabic, as was proper to a Imam, and detailed startling news. The great lands to the north of the Turk had been unified by a follower of Islam once again, and it appears that his wishes was that of positive relations to both states, and a fascinating offer. The great "Pasha" as the Turks called them was to invade Arabia, and he offered the humble servants of Allah in Yemen the opportunity to take back a chunk of the lands of Muhammad, peace be upon him, themselves in the form of the region of Hejaz. Apparently the desert adjusted troops of Yemen would fair far better in the ever lasting desert sands of those holy lands, and would allow for a far quicker and more bloodless victory. Now King and Imam Yahya was by no means a fan of killing fellow Muslims, it was to be avoided at all costs in many situations, but the leader of Arabia had recently sent a rather poor gift to him, so the war appeared to be just. A few days later Enver received a letter, "Peace be upon you brother in faith Enver, most gracious of Pashas, we have decided to accept your agreement to flatten the Arabian horde and see the sands of God under just rule once again, may we meet together in peace forevermore!"

So radios, newspapers, couriers, and one thousand other methods of communication throughout the nation stated the same message, elections would be coming soon, and those interested parties should organize and promote themselves in order to make this election truly fair. Ismet didn't want to half ass this, they needed the people behind them or the whole damn house of cards would have no foundation, and a house without foundation is bad enough, especially one made of paper and hope. Already as the announcement rang out a few interested groups began their registration, all of them being pretty usual fair, conservatives and socialists with a few liberals here and there. There was one group that lacked in the registration however, but they would most likely be no problem, they were a bunch of nutjobs anyways, who would listen to them?"

 tur.21.t:0 "Horse of Tar, Brain of Coal"
 tur.21.d:0 "It turned out that that small group of nutjobs actually had quite a few people who listened to them with quite a lot of seriousness, and with that seriousness the group managed to pump out a manifesto of their ideals within a week of the announcement of free democratic elections within the country. The Black Arrow Kemalists, as they called themselves, were a sect of radical Kemalists influenced by various far right movements and philosophies, many of which the savvy spectator would understand to be somewhat of a contradiction to the ideals actually expressed in the ideology of Kemalism and the wishes of Kemal himself, in which that spectator would probably be correct. But to them, the devil is in the details of what a Populist Secular State actually meant, and a horrific entho-nationalist format of the belief system was basically functional as long as you didn't think to hard about it. In their manifesto the organization stated a variety of their basic goals, the purification of the Turkish race, the raising of the state to a article of worship, the abandonment of left leaning land reform and economic policy instead folding into Corporatism, and a complete and total opposition to any form of democracy within the Turkish state. To the Arrowists, even having local elections was a betrayal of Kemal's ideals, and only through the absolute consolidation of the state and the abolition of the individual will could Kemal's dream truly become reality. So from this ranting and raving the Arrowists decried Ismet in many different rude names, stating his left leaning and democratic ideals were a betrayal to everything Kemal fought for, and that how if he is not deposed before the election and pure military rule is not restored, then the Arrowists will fight back against this corruption with the force of the sun itself, tossing back the Revisionists into the pit from which they came."

 tur.23.t:0 "Storm Prep"
 tur.23.d:0 "As the generals laid out the map of Turkey before Ismet, they spoke of the impending revolt that would most probably arise from their attempt at a democratic election within Turkey. The revolt had roughly three regions it could pop up in, all of which presented their own dangers and boons for both side of the impending conflict. The east would most probably be the safest for the Arrowists, as it would allow a solid baseline of defence in the mountainous regions which were crawling with anti-government sentiment which could easily be exploited. The second safest choice for the Arrowists would be the center of the country. It was also rather mountainous and included many major population centers, but it could be easily surrounded and would require a quick breakout and expansion to make use of it's many cities and proximity to the capital. The most dangerous, and probably stupidest, region would be the west. Much of the military was already stationed there, and it would be extremely easy to surround and destroy any revolts which appeared in the area. However, its extremely close proximity to the capital and the heart of Turkish industry would mean if the enemy did succeed there, victory would be almost assured on their end. Ismet thought over his options, he was aware of the slightly moronic tenancies of the Arrowists, but underestimating your enemy would lead to nothing but failure and defeat. After thinking it over and consulting with his generals, Ismet placed the civil guard in..."

 tur.24.d:0 "Well the election did technically take place.\nThe voting day started out shockingly calm in the coastal city of İzmir, there were no paramilitaries marching down the streets, no jackbooted thugs breaking the ballot boxes and generally making a mess of things. In fact there was nearly nothing for the entire day, but as the last few votes were cast, chanting could be heard from the ancient city of Smyrna's ruins. "The Turkish Dream, the Turkish Dream" was shouted over and over as massive waves of men clad in black broke into every possible voting establishment and wrecked and killed everyone and thing they could. It was shouted from every rooftop and every street, Turkey would not abandon the will of Kemal for the sake of "Democracy", in fact if Democracy was a direct threat to his dream, they would kill it like roadkill down the road of the dream. The city police tried their best to slow the tide, but they were met with a horrific wall of gunfire and artillery. İzmir had been fortified as the Arrowist militants and ex-military made their stand against the tyranny of a government against tyranny. As the city was captured, the Arrowists sent a taunt to Ismet, demanding his "democratic" response to their actions. The central government, Ismet especially, found themselves with what was once a mild headache into a tumor in the side of the Turkish nation, a band of idiots and radicals who for some reason believed that Kemal would've wanted them destroying the very country he had worked so hard to unify. They were fucking morons, that much was clear, but unfortunately they were well armed fucking morons who currently occupied the city of İzmir. Ismet died a little inside at the news, but he knew full well how the old saying goes, the tree of democracy must be water with blood. If they were not able to accept progress and change through peaceful means, then they must know the glory of democracy, by force."

 tur.26.d:0 "Private Berkant had joined the Black Arrows for many of the same reasons that other members had joined, he was young, only 17, and wanted action and adventure and a revival of the Kemalist dream. The uniform of the Black Arrows had attracted many people to their group, with pseudo-military uniforms dyed black with piping of red, and with officers finding themselves in jet black leather jackets, the fashion aspect was incredibly appealing. Berkant tried to remind himself of that appeal, he had dropped out of university to join them of course, and their promises of adventure had been nothing but exactly what he had been waiting for. But now he stood over the body of a dead college student, only a year or two older then he was, his blood slowly draining from his head and caking itself on Berkant's boots. His brains were scattered across the university pavement, and several students nearby screamed in abject horror at the sigh of his lifeless body. This student could have been him, he had only been a kid, he had had his whole life in front of him. Berkant had just taken his life from him, and why had he taken it? Just so he could help some regime because it had given him cool clothes and a false purpose? Because he had been protesting peacefully, without a betrayal to the ideas of Kemal? What was a purpose worth if it entailed the death of his friends, his family, and his fellow youths? He looked to the men that surrounded them, some of them had seen this happen before, but for others Berkant could see the paleness of their soul at the sight of their actions, and the questions of morality that laid in their faces. It is normal for youths to think themselves invincible, but once they are faced with horror they often shrink and come to realize the state that they are in, and either continue on within it or decide to break free from the cycle."

 tur.27.t:0 "Temizlik: Kıdemli"
 tur.27.d:0 "A large group of around 30 people bust into the small military office seated within some town in Anatolia. The office was slightly decrepit but managed to hold itself together more by spirit then any sort of physical reality, papers were thrown lazily on any open surface, but most especially the three desks of the current military clerks who were seated within the office. The group was headed by a rather young looking man in a black leather jacket, his chin was poor and his posture was worse, but he clearly demanded some sort of respect from the rabble of black clad paramilitary immediately behind him. He spoke, his clearly practiced speech being broken only by voice cracks: "On the official order of the Military Administration of Turkey, led by the Black Arrows movement, all Revisionist officers which includes any persons of a left wing or religious persuasion, shall have their position immediately revoke in accordance with the newest act of the Kemalist purification law.". The young officer waited impatiently as the three clerks processed what the boy had said, they were aware of no such Kemalist purification law, nor were they aware of a new administration. The clerk on the left jumped up from his seat and began a verbal protest, but before he could even let out a word he was gunned down by two of the men behind the young officer. His desk was luckily saved from the hail of bullet fire, but his blood began to seep into the various papers the man had been working on, which would probably put back this office by at least a day or two. The other two clerks quickly complied and sent out the order, all leftists and Islamists shall be removed from their posts. Madanoğlu had been visiting this region at the time in an effort to stay away from the troubles in the capital, and he had luckily been close to the radio when the order was given out. As quickly as he possible could, he stole a motorcycle and managed to escape to the city of Zonguldak."

 tur.28.t:0 "Red Sun, Black Day"
 tur.28.d:0 "was roughly 3:32 PM in the Anıtkabir, various tour guides were showing people around the mausoleum and it was set for later that the new Black Arrow leadership were going to make a speech there. The idea was to commemorate the life of Kemal and his achievements, and the Anıtkabir for many represented the legitimacy of the Arrowist regime. It's walls and tomb were what the very soul of Kemal walked in, and whoever held his soul held his ideas with an iron grip. The Arrowists had made sure to plaster the palace with his likeness and as much imagery as possible, as well as items of his life and death. It was strange, almost set up like a museum  by the Arrowists, the place had become a center of the deification of a man who would most likely not enjoy that some people worshipped him so strongly, especially since his death was only a few years ago. A few men in suits walked into the mausoleum, they seemed official in their nature with their straight posture and overbearing presence, many assumed that they were government agents. At 3:46 PM these same men walked away and hopped into a jet black truck, and slowly and calmly drove away from the scene. At 4:00 PM a speech was started with the main Arrowist leadership, all of them praising the dream of Kemal and other such tired propagandist speak. Then, an explosion, the whole structure found itself collapsing on the leadership and civilians alike, with the head of the hydra cut off in one swift movement. At the scene of the crime there were leaflets spread, speaking of some Anatolian Revolutionary and his faithful teachings, and condemning the terrible dictatorship of the Arrowist scum. The people were quite shocked at the news, the entire legitimacy of the Arrowists had come from their dedication to Kemal's ideals and to the presence of their leadership, and both had just found themselves buried in several tons of rubble. The people panicked, the government panicked, and an anarchy like no other set the Turkish nation ablaze in a matter of days as any attempt to keep the Arrowists holding onto power fell flat. Armies, political groups, militias, and foreign interest found themselves sucking at the blood of the people and cutting their own fiefdoms amongst the chaos. Again Turkey finds itself in the most horrible of anarchy, and again there seems to be nobody who can save it from its horrid fate."

He had been chosen out of his position to get the nice and cozy job of training the newly friendly Turkish Marines in a variety of exercises with his own group of Marines that had been sent alongside him. Kennedy didn't like the job, didn't smell right, felt like he was being swept under the rug due to something but he didn't know exactly what. Still, now Captain Kennedy was sitting pretty in his Istanbul office when he heard it over the radio, it appeared as if the entire damn government had gone and shit the bed, and there was essentially nothing holding back this country from complete and utter anarchy. Well, he had led a PT boat under fire before, how different is leading a country anyways? He set a meeting with the officers of the US Marines, Turkish Marines, and Turkish Navy and set them a frank ultimatum. "Well I'll be honest men, it seems as if we are stuck in a restaurant without clam chowder. I will not pretend that I am the most experience or the best equipped for this task, but I ask you to band together as a common people, we shall bring democracy to these lands, and even if we die doing it, we will die as better men for it.". Thankfully they found common ground as Navy men, and fortified Istanbul, trying to consolidate as much land and as many civilians as possible before the other warlords began to grab their own. Kennedy's regime has been a source of hope throughout the region despite his foreign nature and young age, with refugees flowing in to escape the brutal warlord states that surround them.
